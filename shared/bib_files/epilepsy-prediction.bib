  abstract = {The field of autoimmune epilepsy has evolved substantially in the last few decades with discovery of several neural autoantibodies and improved mechanistic understanding of these immune-mediated syndromes. A considerable proportion of patients with epilepsy of unknown etiology have been demonstrated to have an autoimmune cause. The majority of the patients with autoimmune epilepsy usually present with new-onset refractory seizures along with subacute progressive cognitive decline and behavioral or psychiatric dysfunction. Neural specific antibodies commonly associated with autoimmune epilepsy include leucine-rich glioma-inactivated protein 1 (LGI1), N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA-R), and glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65) IgG. Diagnosis of these cases depends on the identification of the clinical syndrome and ancillary studies including autoantibody evaluation. Predictive models (Antibody Prevalence in Epilepsy and Encephalopathy [APE2] and Response to Immunotherapy in Epilepsy and Encephalopathy [RITE2] scores) based on clinical features and initial neurological assessment may be utilized for selection of cases for autoimmune epilepsy evaluation and management. In this article, we will review the recent advances in autoimmune epilepsy and provide diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms for epilepsies with suspected autoimmune etiology.},

  abstract = {Epilepsy is well-recognized as a disorder of brain networks. There is a growing body of research to identify critical nodes within dynamic epileptic networks with the aim to target therapies that halt the onset and propagation of seizures. In parallel, intracranial neuromodulation, including deep brain stimulation and responsive neurostimulation, are well-established and expanding as therapies to reduce seizures in adults with focal-onset epilepsy; and there is emerging evidence for their efficacy in children and generalized-onset seizure disorders. The convergence of these advancing fields is driving an era of 'network-guided neuromodulation' for epilepsy. In this review, we distil the current literature on network mechanisms underlying neurostimulation for epilepsy. We discuss the modulation of key 'propagation points' in the epileptogenic network, focusing primarily on thalamic nuclei targeted in current clinical practice. These include (i) the anterior nucleus of thalamus, now a clinically approved and targeted site for open loop stimulation, and increasingly targeted for responsive neurostimulation; and (ii) the centromedian nucleus of the thalamus, a target for both deep brain stimulation and responsive neurostimulation in generalized-onset epilepsies. We discuss briefly the networks associated with other emerging neuromodulation targets, such as the pulvinar of the thalamus, piriform cortex, septal area, subthalamic nucleus, cerebellum and others. We report synergistic findings garnered from multiple modalities of investigation that have revealed structural and functional networks associated with these propagation points - including scalp and invasive EEG, and diffusion and functional MRI. We also report on intracranial recordings from implanted devices which provide us data on the dynamic networks we are aiming to modulate. Finally, we review the continuing evolution of network-guided neuromodulation for epilepsy to accelerate progress towards two translational goals: (i) to use pre-surgical network analyses to determine patient candidacy for neurostimulation for epilepsy by providing network biomarkers that predict efficacy; and (ii) to deliver precise, personalized and effective antiepileptic stimulation to prevent and arrest seizure propagation through mapping and modulation of each patients' individual epileptogenic networks.},

  abstract = {Epilepsy, a neurological disease characterized by recurrent seizures, is highly heterogeneous in nature. Based on the prevalence, epilepsy is classified into two types: common and rare epilepsies. Common epilepsies affecting nearly 95\% people with epilepsy, comprise generalized epilepsy which encompass idiopathic generalized epilepsy like childhood absence epilepsy, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, juvenile absence epilepsy and epilepsy with generalized tonic-clonic seizure on awakening and focal epilepsy like temporal lobe epilepsy and cryptogenic focal epilepsy. In 70\% of the epilepsy cases, genetic factors are responsible either as single genetic variant in rare epilepsies or multiple genetic variants acting along with different environmental factors as in common epilepsies. Genetic testing and precision treatment have been developed for a few rare epilepsies and is lacking for common epilepsies due to their complex nature of inheritance. Precision medicine for common epilepsies require a panoramic approach that incorporates polygenic background and other non-genetic factors like microbiome, diet, age at disease onset, optimal time for treatment and other lifestyle factors which influence seizure threshold. This review aims to comprehensively present a state-of-art review of all the genes and their genetic variants that are associated with all common epilepsy subtypes. It also encompasses the basis of these genes in the epileptogenesis. Here, we discussed the current status of the common epilepsy genetics and address the clinical application so far on evidence-based markers in prognosis, diagnosis, and treatment management. In addition, we assessed the diagnostic predictability of a few genetic markers used for disease risk prediction in individuals. A combination of deeper endo-phenotyping including pharmaco-response data, electro-clinical imaging, and other clinical measurements along with genetics may be used to diagnose common epilepsies and this marks a step ahead in precision medicine in common epilepsies management.},

  abstract = {A monogenic etiology can be identified in up to 40\% of people with severe epilepsy. To address earlier and more appropriate treatment strategies, clinicians are required to know the implications that specific genetic causes might have on pathophysiology, natural history, comorbidities, and treatment choices. In this narrative review, we summarize concepts on the genetic epilepsies based on the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms and present the current knowledge on treatment options based on evidence provided by controlled trials or studies with lower classification of evidence. Overall, evidence robust enough to guide antiseizure medication (ASM) choices in genetic epilepsies remains limited to the more frequent conditions for which controlled trials and observational studies have been possible. Most monogenic disorders are very rare and ASM choices for them are still based on inferences drawn from observational studies and early, often anecdotal, experiences with precision therapies. Precision medicine remains applicable to only a narrow number of patients with monogenic epilepsies and may target only part of the actual functional defects. Phenotypic heterogeneity is remarkable, and some genetic mutations activate epileptogenesis through their developmental effects, which may not be reversed postnatally. Other genes seem to have pure functional consequences on excitability, acting through either loss- or gain-of-function effects, and these may have opposite treatment implications. In addition, the functional consequences of missense mutations may be difficult to predict, making precision treatment approaches considerably more complex than estimated by deterministic interpretations. Knowledge of genetic etiologies can influence the approach to surgical treatment of focal epilepsies. Identification of germline mutations in specific genes contraindicates surgery while mutations in other genes do not. Identification, quantification, and functional characterization of specific somatic mutations before surgery using CSF liquid biopsy or after surgery in brain specimens will likely be integrated in planning surgical strategies and reintervention after a first unsuccessful surgery as initial evidence suggests that mutational load may correlate with the epileptogenic zone. Promising future directions include gene manipulation by DNA or mRNA targeting; although most are still far from clinical use, some are in early phase clinical development.},

  abstract = {In the past two decades, significant advances have been made on automated electroencephalogram (EEG)-based diagnosis of epilepsy and seizure detection. A number of innovative algorithms have been introduced that can aid in epilepsy diagnosis with a high degree of accuracy. In recent years, the frontiers of computational epilepsy research have moved to seizure prediction, a more challenging problem. While antiepileptic medication can result in complete seizure freedom in many patients with epilepsy, up to one-third of patients living with epilepsy will have medically intractable epilepsy, where medications reduce seizure frequency but do not completely control seizures. If a seizure can be predicted prior to its clinical manifestation, then there is potential for abortive treatment to be given, either self-administered or via an implanted device administering medication or electrical stimulation. This will have a far-reaching impact on the treatment of epilepsy and patient's quality of life. This paper presents a state-of-the-art review of recent efforts and journal articles on seizure prediction. The technologies developed for epilepsy diagnosis and seizure detection are being adapted and extended for seizure prediction. The paper ends with some novel ideas for seizure prediction using the increasingly ubiquitous machine learning technology, particularly deep neural network machine learning.},

  abstract = {Dravet syndrome is a severe epileptic encephalopathy, characterized by (febrile) seizures, behavioural problems and developmental delay. Eighty per cent of patients with Dravet syndrome have a mutation in SCN1A, encoding Nav1.1. Milder clinical phenotypes, such as GEFS+ (generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus), can also arise from SCN1A mutations. Predicting the clinical phenotypic outcome based on the type of mutation remains challenging, even when the same mutation is inherited within one family. This clinical and genetic heterogeneity adds to the difficulties of predicting disease progression and tailoring the prescription of anti-seizure medication. Understanding the neuropathology of different SCN1A mutations may help to predict the expected clinical phenotypes and inform the selection of best-fit treatments. Initially, the loss of Na+-current in inhibitory neurons was recognized specifically to result in disinhibition and consequently seizure generation. However, the extent to which excitatory neurons contribute to the pathophysiology is currently debated and might depend on the patient clinical phenotype or the specific SCN1A mutation. To examine the genotype-phenotype correlations of SCN1A mutations in relation to excitatory neurons, we investigated a panel of patient-derived excitatory neuronal networks differentiated on multi-electrode arrays. We included patients with different clinical phenotypes, harbouring various SCN1A mutations, along with a family in which the same mutation led to febrile seizures, GEFS+ or Dravet syndrome. We hitherto describe a previously unidentified functional excitatory neuronal network phenotype in the context of epilepsy, which corresponds to seizurogenic network prediction patterns elicited by proconvulsive compounds. We found that excitatory neuronal networks were affected differently, depending on the type of SCN1A mutation, but did not segregate according to clinical severity. Specifically, loss-of-function mutations could be distinguished from missense mutations, and mutations in the pore domain could be distinguished from mutations in the voltage sensing domain. Furthermore, all patients showed aggravated neuronal network responses at febrile temperatures compared with controls. Finally, retrospective drug screening revealed that anti-seizure medication affected GEFS+ patient- but not Dravet patient-derived neuronal networks in a patient-specific and clinically relevant manner. In conclusion, our results indicate a mutation-specific excitatory neuronal network phenotype, which recapitulates the foremost clinically relevant features, providing future opportunities for precision therapies.},

  abstract = {Epilepsy neuroimaging is important for detecting the seizure onset zone, predicting and preventing deficits from surgery and illuminating mechanisms of epileptogenesis. An aspiration is to integrate imaging and genetic biomarkers to enable personalized epilepsy treatments.

Statistical analysis of PET and single photon emission computer tomography (STATISCOM) are superior to qualitative analysis alone in identifying focal abnormalities in MRI-negative patients. These methods have also been used to study mechanisms of epileptogenesis and pharmacoresistance.Recent language fMRI studies aim to localize, and also lateralize language functions. Memory fMRI has been recommended to lateralize mnemonic function and predict outcome after surgery in temporal lobe epilepsy.

We retrospectively reviewed all the long-term video-EEG reports from Jefferson Comprehensive Epilepsy Center over a 12-year period (2004-2015) for the occurrence of the terms "cry" or "sob" or "weep" in the text body. All the extracted reports were reviewed, and patients with at least one episode of documented ictal crying at the epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) were included in the study. During the study period, 5133 patients were investigated at our EMU. Thirty-two patients (0.6\%) had at least one documented seizure accompanied by crying. Twenty-seven patients (26 women and one man) had psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES), and five patients (0.1\%) had epilepsy. Among patients with epileptic ictal crying, four patients had focal epilepsy (two had definite, and two had probable frontal lobe epilepsy), while one patient had Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Ictal crying is a rare finding among patients evaluated at the EMUs. The most common underlying etiology for ictal crying is PNES. However, ictal crying is not a specific sign for PNES. Epileptic ictal crying is often a rare type of partial seizure in patients with focal epilepsy.

Structural MRI at 7T with optimization of acquisition and postacquisition image processing increases the diagnostic yield but artefactual findings remain a challenge.

Structural and functional connectivity relate to seizure spread and generalization; longitudinal studies are needed to clarify the causal relationship of these associations. Diffusion MRI may help predict surgical outcome and network abnormalities extending beyond the epileptogenic zone. Three-dimensional multimodal imaging can increase the precision of epilepsy surgery, improve seizure outcome and reduce complications. Language and memory fMRI are useful predictors of postoperative deficits, and lead to risk minimization. FDG PET is useful for clinical studies and specific ligands probe the pathophysiology of neurochemical fluxes and receptor abnormalities. Improved structural MRI increases detection of abnormalities that may underlie epilepsy. Diffusion, structural and functional MRI indicate the widespread associations of epilepsy syndromes.

  abstract = {The epilepsies are one of the most common serious brain disorders, can occur at all ages, and have many possible presentations and causes. Although incidence in childhood has fallen over the past three decades in developed countries, this reduction is matched by an increase in elderly people. Monogenic Mendelian epilepsies are rare. A clinical syndrome often has multiple possible genetic causes, and conversely, different mutations in one gene can lead to various epileptic syndromes. Most common epilepsies, however, are probably complex traits with environmental effects acting on inherited susceptibility, mediated by common variation in particular genes. Diagnosis of epilepsy remains clinical, and neurophysiological investigations assist with diagnosis of the syndrome. Brain imaging is making great progress in identifying the structural and functional causes and consequences of the epilepsies. Current antiepileptic drugs suppress seizures without influencing the underlying tendency to generate seizures, and are effective in 60-70\% of individuals. Pharmacogenetic studies hold the promise of being able to better individualise treatment for each patient, with maximum possibility of benefit and minimum risk of adverse effects. For people with refractory focal epilepsy, neurosurgical resection offers the possibility of a life-changing cure. Potential new treatments include precise prediction of seizures and focal therapy with drug delivery, neural stimulation, and biological grafts.},

This cohort study developed and validated a prognostic model. Patients were treated between 1982 and 2020. All patients were followed up for a minimum of 1 year or until failure of the first ASM. A total of 2404 adults with epilepsy newly treated at specialist clinics in Scotland, Malaysia, Australia, and China between 1982 and 2020 were considered for inclusion, of whom 606 (25.2\%) were excluded from the final cohort because of missing information in 1 or more variables. One of 7 antiseizure medications. With the use of the transformer model architecture on 16 clinical factors and ASM information, this cohort study first pooled all cohorts for model training and testing. The model was trained again using the largest cohort and externally validated on the other 4 cohorts. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), weighted balanced accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the model were all assessed for predicting treatment success based on the optimal probability cutoff. Treatment success was defined as complete seizure freedom for the first year of treatment while taking the first ASM. Performance of the transformer model was compared with other machine learning models. The final pooled cohort included 1798 adults (54.5\% female; median age, 34 years [IQR, 24-50 years]). The transformer model that was trained using the pooled cohort had an AUROC of 0.65 (95\% CI, 0.63-0.67) and a weighted balanced accuracy of 0.62 (95\% CI, 0.60-0.64) on the test set. The model that was trained using the largest cohort only had AUROCs ranging from 0.52 to 0.60 and a weighted balanced accuracy ranging from 0.51 to 0.62 in the external validation cohorts. Number of pretreatment seizures, presence of psychiatric disorders, electroencephalography, and brain imaging findings were the most important clinical variables for predicted outcomes in both models. The transformer model that was developed using the pooled cohort outperformed 2 of the 5 other models tested in terms of AUROC. In this cohort study, a deep learning model showed the feasibility of personalized prediction of response to ASMs based on clinical information.

From the perspective of dynamical systems theory, such critical transitions occur upon inconspicuous perturbations in highly interconnected systems and can be modeled as mathematical bifurcations between alternative regimes. The predictability of critical transitions represents a major challenge, but the theory predicts the appearance of subtle dynamical signatures on the verge of instability. Whether such dynamical signatures can be measured before impending seizures remains uncertain. Here, we verified that predictions on bifurcations applied to the onset of hippocampal seizures, providing concordant results from in silico modeling, optogenetics experiments in male mice and intracranial EEG recordings in human patients with epilepsy. Leveraging pharmacological control over neural excitability, we showed that the boundary between physiological excitability and seizures can be inferred from dynamical signatures passively recorded or actively probed in hippocampal circuits. Of importance for the design of future neurotechnologies, active probing surpassed passive recording to decode underlying levels of neural excitability, notably when assessed from a network of propagating neural responses. Our findings provide a promising approach for predicting and preventing seizures, based on a sound understanding of their dynamics.},

Paralleled scientific developments have deepened our understanding of the neurophysiology underlying photosensitivity, especially in the context of deep genomic sequencing and neuroimaging. Furthermore, given the relatively predictable nature of photosensitive epilepsy, there is substantial interest in translating advancements in this field to epilepsy as a whole. Herein, we comprehensively review the epidemiology, clinical features and novel insights into the mechanism behind photosensitive epilepsy with a focus on the clinical implications of new advancements.},

  abstract = {The emergence of telemedicine and artificial intelligence (AI) has set the stage for a possible revolution in the future of medicine and neurology including the diagnosis and management of epilepsy. Telemedicine, with its proven efficacy during the COVID-19 pandemic, offers the advantage of bridging the gap between patients in resource-limited areas and specialized care, where in one study telemedicine reduced the epilepsy treatment gap from 43 \% to 9 \%. AI innovations promise a transformation in epilepsy care by possibly enhancing the accuracy of electroencephalogram (EEG) interpretation and seizure prediction through machine and deep learning. In one study, abnormal EEG recordings were classified into different categories using a convolutional neural networks (CNN) model showing a specificity of 90 \% and an accuracy of 88.3 \%. Other models constructed to predict seizures have also achieved a sensitivity of 96.8 \% and specificity of 95.5 \%. Various machine learning (ML) models highlight the potential AI holds in identifying interictal biomarkers and localizing seizure onset zones aiding in epilepsy treatment decision and outcome prediction. An ML model highlighted in this review localized seizure onset zone with an accuracy reaching 73 \% and predicted surgical outcomes with an accuracy reaching 79 \% compared to the 43 \% accuracy of clinicians. However, limitations and challenges hinder the application of such technologies to reach their full potential in epilepsy care. Limitations include access to compatible devices, integration into clinical workflows, data bias, and availability of sufficient data. Extensive validated research is needed to guide future clinical practice with the implementation of technology-enhanced epilepsy care. This narrative review article will explore the use of AI and telemedicine in EEG and epilepsy care, examining their individual and combined impacts in shaping the future of epilepsy care and discussing the challenges and limitations faced in their usage.},

  abstract = {Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is a devastating yet overlooked complication of epilepsy. The rare and complex nature of SUDEP makes it challenging to study. No prediction or prevention of SUDEP is currently available in a clinical setting. In the past decade, significant advances have been made in our knowledge of the pathophysiologic cascades that lead to SUDEP. In particular, studies of brain, heart, and respiratory functions in both human patients at the epilepsy monitoring unit and animal models during fatal seizures provide critical information to integrate computational tools for SUDEP prediction. The rapid advances in automated seizure detection and prediction algorithms provide a fundamental framework for their adaption in predicting SUDEP. If a SUDEP can be predicted, then there will be a potential for medical intervention to be administered, either by their caregivers or via an implanted device automatically delivering electrical stimulation or medication, and finally save lives from fatal seizures. This article presents recent developments of SUDEP studies focusing on the pathophysiologic basis of SUDEP and computational implications of machine learning techniques that can be adapted and extended for SUDEP prediction. This article also discusses some novel ideas for SUDEP prediction and rescue including principal component analysis and closed-loop intervention.},

However, therapeutic molecules derived from animal models often translate poorly to the clinic.

Here, we compare work on animal models and on human tissue for three epileptic syndromes where human tissue is excised therapeutically: (1) acquired temporal lobe epilepsies, (2) inherited epilepsies associated with cortical malformations, and (3) peritumoral epilepsies. Animal models rest on assumed equivalencies between human brains and brains of mice, the most frequently used model animal. We ask how differences between mouse and human brains could influence models. General principles and compromises in model construction and validation are examined for a range of neurological diseases. Models may be judged on how well they predict novel therapeutic molecules or new mechanisms. The efficacy and safety of new molecules are evaluated in clinical trials. We judge new mechanisms by comparing data from work on animal models with data from work on patient tissue. In conclusion, we stress the need to cross-verify findings from animal models and from living human tissue to avoid the assumption that mechanisms are identical.},

Epilepsy causes uncontrollable, unprovoked and unpredictable seizures that reduce the quality of life of those afflicted, with 1-9 epileptic patient deaths per 1000 patients occurring annually due to sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Predicting the onset of seizures and managing them may help patients from harming themselves and may improve their well-being. For a long time, electroencephalography (EEG) devices have been the mainstay for seizure detection and monitoring. This systematic review aimed to elucidate and critically evaluate the latest advancements in medical devices, besides EEG, that have been proposed for the management and prediction of epileptic seizures. A literature search was performed on three databases, PubMed, Scopus and EMBASE. Following title/abstract screening by two independent reviewers, 27 articles were selected for critical analysis in this review. These articles revealed ambulatory, non-invasive and wearable medical devices, such as the in-ear EEG devices; the accelerometer-based devices and the subcutaneous implanted EEG devices might be more acceptable than traditional EEG systems. In addition, extracerebral signalbased devices may be more efficient than EEG-based systems, especially when combined with an intervention trigger. Although further studies may still be required to improve and validate these proposed systems before commercialization, these findings may give hope to epileptic patients, particularly those with refractory epilepsy, to predict and manage their seizures. The use of medical devices for epilepsy may improve patients' independence and quality of life and possibly prevent sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP).},

  abstract = {The primary purpose is to determine whether the time between epilepsy surgery and first seizure recurrence can estimate the timing of the next seizure event for temporal and extratemporal epilepsy. A secondary endpoint aimed to compare temporal and extratemporal epilepsy surgery and examine which subgroup has a higher hazard of subsequent seizure recurrence. Data used were from a retrospective database at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital. Records were stratified into temporal (n = 943) and extratemporal (n = 125) surgeries. Analyses were done using SAS and utilized Cox proportional hazards models while controlling for demographics and clinical factors. The primary predictor of time between surgery and first recurrence was treated as a nominal variable binned into six segments, whereas secondary endpoints used a categorical predictor of epilepsy location while controlling for seizure latency. Generally, as seizure latency following surgery increased, the time between first seizure and second seizure increased. These results were statistically meaningful in the temporal set (Wald chi-squared = 40.4715, df = 5, p < .0001). Outcomes could also be interpreted based on predictor group; for instance, if Seizure 1 occurred 1-2 months following surgery in the temporal set, the median number of days until the next seizure was 35.5 days (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 21-89 days). Secondary analysis showed that temporal lobe epilepsy had a lower hazard of a second seizure than extratemporal lobe epilepsy (89.2\% reduction in hazard; 95\% CI = .015-.795). This analysis provides a framework to use initial seizure latency to predict the median number of days until the next seizure event, while stratifying based on epilepsy location and controlling for multiple variables. It also suggests that the hazard of seizure recurrence in temporal lobe epilepsy is lower than in extratemporal lobe epilepsy.},

Moreover, no treatments exist to prevent the development of epilepsy in those at risk, despite an increasing understanding of the underlying molecular and cellular pathways. One of the major factors that have impeded rapid progress in these areas is the complex and multifactorial nature of epilepsy, and its heterogeneity. Therefore, the vision of developing targeted treatments for epilepsy relies upon the development of biomarkers that allow individually tailored treatment. Biomarkers for epilepsy typically fall into two broad categories: diagnostic biomarkers, which provide information on the clinical status of, and potentially the sensitivity to, specific treatments, and prognostic biomarkers, which allow prediction of future clinical features, such as the speed of progression, severity of epilepsy, development of comorbidities, or prediction of remission or cure. Prognostic biomarkers are of particular importance because they could be used to identify which patients will develop epilepsy and which might benefit from preventive treatments. Biomarker research faces several challenges; however, biomarkers could substantially improve the management of people with epilepsy and could lead to prevention in the right person at the right time, rather than just symptomatic treatment.},

Early prediction of seizures and effective intervention can significantly reduce the harm suffered by patients. In this paper, a method based on nonlinear features of EEG signal and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) is proposed for early prediction of epilepsy seizures. First, the EEG signals were divided into two categories: those that had seizures onset over a period of time (represented by InT) and those that did not. Second, the noise in the EEG was removed using complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD) and wavelet threshold denoising. Third, the nonlinear features of the two categories of EEG were extracted, including approximate entropy, sample entropy, permutation entropy, spectral entropy and wavelet entropy. Fourth, a GBDT classifier with random forest as the initial result was designed to distinguish the two categories of EEG. Fifth, a two-step "k of n" method was used to reduce the number of false alarms. The proposed method was evaluated on 13 patients' EEG data from the CHB-MIT Scalp EEG Database. Based on ten-fold cross validation, the average accuracy was 91.76\% when the InT was taken at 30 min, and 38 out of 39 seizures were successfully predicted. When the InT was taken for 40 min, the average accuracy was 92.50\% and all 42 seizures selected were successfully predicted. The results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method for predicting epilepsy seizures.},

For these cases biomarkers of epileptogenesis are critical to facilitate identification of patients at high-risk of developing epilepsy and to introduce effective anti-epileptogenic interventions. Here, we demonstrate that delayed brain-heart coincidences serve as a reliable biomarker. In a murine model of post-infection acquired epilepsy, we used long-term simultaneous measurements of the brain activity via electroencephalography and autonomic cardiac activity via electrocardiography, in male mice, to quantitatively track brain-heart interactions during epileptogenesis. We find that abnormal cortical discharges precede abnormal fluctuations in the cardiac rhythm at the resolution of single beat-to-beat intervals. The delayed brain-heart coincidence is detectable as early as the onset of chronic measurements, 2-14 weeks before the first seizure, only in animals that become epileptic, and increases during epileptogenesis. Therefore, delayed brain-heart coincidence serves as a biomarker of epileptogenesis and could be used for phenotyping, diagnostic, and therapeutic purposes.},

  abstract = {Myoclonus can be epileptic or nonepileptic. Epileptic myoclonus has been defined in clinical, neurophysiological, and neuroanatomical terms. Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) is typically considered to be an adolescent-onset idiopathic generalized epilepsy with a combination of myoclonic, generalized tonic-clonic, and absence seizures and normal cognitive status that responds well to anti-seizure medications but requires lifelong treatment. EEG shows generalized epileptiform discharges and photosensitivity. Recent observations indicate that the clinical picture of JME is heterogeneous and a number of neuropsychological and imaging studies have shown structural and functional abnormalities in the frontal lobes and thalamus. Advances in neurophysiology and imaging suggest that JME may not be a truly generalized epilepsy, in that restricted cortical and subcortical networks appear to be involved rather than the entire brain. Some patients with JME may be refractory to anti-seizure medications and attempts have been made to identify neurophysiological biomarkers predicting resistance. Progressive myoclonic epilepsy is a syndrome with multiple specific causes. It is distinct from JME because of the occurrence of progressive neurologic dysfunction in addition to myoclonus and generalized tonic-clonic seizures but may sometimes be difficult to distinguish from JME or misdiagnosed as drug-resistant JME. This article provides an overview of progressive myoclonic epilepsy and focuses on the clinical and neurophysiological findings in the two most commonly recognized forms of progressive myoclonic epilepsy-Unverricht-Lundborg disease (EPM1) and Lafora disease (EPM2).

In this study, we performed a literature review, summarized the causes of significant variability in the risk of postwithdrawal recurrent seizures, and reviewed study data on the age at onset, cause, types of seizures, epilepsy syndrome, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities, epilepsy surgery, and withdrawal outcomes of patients with epilepsy. Many factors are associated with recurrent seizures after AED withdrawal. For patients who are seizure-free after treatment, the role of an electroencephalogram (EEG) alone in ensuring safe withdrawal is limited. A series of prediction models for the postwithdrawal recurrence risk have incorporated various potentially important factors in a comprehensive analysis. We focused on the populations of studies investigating five risk prediction models and analyzed the predictive variables and recommended applications of each model, aiming to provide a reference for personalized withdrawal for patients with epilepsy in clinical practice.},

  abstract = {Structural and functional imaging prior to surgery in drug-resistant focal epilepsy, has an important role to play alongside electroencephalography (EEG) techniques, in planning the surgical approach and predicting post-operative outcome. This paper reviews the role of structural and functional imaging of the brain, namely computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional MRI (fMRI), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in the preoperative work-up of people with medically refractory epilepsy. In MRI-negative patients, the precise localisation of the epileptogenic zone may be established by demonstrating hypometabolism on PET imaging or hyperperfusion on SPECT imaging in the area surrounding the seizure focus. These imaging modalities are far less invasive than intracranial EEG, which is the gold standard but requires surgical placement of electrodes or recording grids. Even when intracranial EEG is needed, PET or SPECT imaging can assist in the planning of EEG electrode placement, due to its' limited spatial sampling. Multimodal imaging techniques now allow the multidisciplinary epilepsy surgery team to identify and better characterise focal pathology, determine its' relationship to eloquent areas of the brain and the degree of interconnectedness within both physiological and pathological networks, as well as improve planning and surgical outcomes for patients. This paper will update the reader on this whole field and provide them with a practical guide, to aid them in the selection of appropriate investigations, interpretation of the findings and facilitating patient discussions in individuals with drug-resistant focal epilepsy.},

A strategy receiving increased attention is using interictal spike patterns and continuous EEG measurements from epileptic patients to predict and ultimately control seizure activity via chemical or electrical control systems. This work compares results of seven linear and nonlinear methods (analysis of power spectra, cross-correlation, principal components, phase, wavelets, correlation integral, and mutual prediction) in detecting the earliest dynamical changes preceding 12 intracranially-recorded seizures from 4 patients. A method of counting standard deviations was used to compare across methods, and the earliest departures from thresholds determined from non-seizure EEG were compared to a neurologist's judgement. For these data, the nonlinear methods offered no predictive advantage over the linear methods. All the methods described here were successful in detecting changes leading to a seizure between one and two minutes before the first changes noted by the neurologist, although analysis of phase correlation proved the most robust. The success of phase analysis may be due in part to its complete insensitivity to amplitude, which may provide a significant source of error.},

Whereas many studies have explored the role of CNVs in sporadic or severe cases, fewer have been done in familial generalized and focal epilepsies. We analyzed exome sequence data from 267 multiplex families and 859 first-degree relative pairs with a diagnosis of genetic generalized epilepsies or nonacquired focal epilepsies to predict CNVs. Validation and segregation studies were performed using an orthogonal method when possible. We identified CNVs likely to contribute to epilepsy risk or etiology in the probands of 43 of 1116 (3.9\%) families, including known recurrent CNVs (16p13.11 deletion, 15q13.3 deletion, 15q11.2 deletion, 16p11.2 duplication, 1q21.1 duplication, and 5-Mb duplication of 15q11q13). We also identified CNVs affecting monogenic epilepsy genes, including four families with CNVs disrupting the DEPDC5 gene, and a de novo deletion of HNRNPU in one affected individual from a multiplex family. Several large CNVs (>500 kb) of uncertain clinical significance were identified, including a deletion in 18q, a large duplication encompassing the SCN1A gene, and a 15q13.3 duplication (BP4-BP5). The overall CNV landscape in common familial epilepsies is similar to that of sporadic epilepsies, with large recurrent deletions at 15q11, 15q13, and 16p13 contributing in 2.5\%-3\% of families. CNVs that interrupt known epilepsy genes and rare, large CNVs were also identified. Multiple etiologies were found in a subset of families, emphasizing the importance of genetic testing for multiple affected family members. Rare CNVs found in a single proband remain difficult to interpret and require larger cohorts to confirm their potential role in disease. Overall, our work indicates that CNVs contribute to the complex genetic architecture of familial generalized and focal epilepsies, supporting the role for clinical testing in affected individuals.},

Our aim in this study to evaluate the genotype and phenotype correlation of patients with SCN variants in our tertiary care center. In this retrospective study, patients with SCN variants and epilepsy who were followed up at our clinic between 2018 and 2022 were evaluated. Our study discussed the demographics of the patients, the seizure types, the age of seizure onset, the SCN variants, the domains and the functions of the variants, the magnetic resonance imaging findings, the motor, cognitive, and psychiatric comorbidities, and the response to anti-seizure medication. Genetic testing was conducted using a next-generation sequencing gene panel (epilepsy panel) or a whole-exome sequencing. For evaluating variant function, we used a prediction tool (https://funnc.shinyapps.io/shinyappweb/ site). To assess protein domains, we used the PER viewer (http://per.broadinstitute.org/). Twenty-three patients with SCN variants and epilepsy have been identified. Sixteen patients had variants in the SCN1A, six patients had variants in the SCN2A, and one patient had a variant in the SCN3A. Two novel SCN1A variants and two novel SCN2A variants were identified. The analysis revealed 14/23 missense, 6/23 nonsense, 2/23 frameshift, and 1/23 splice site variants in the SCN. There are seven variants predicted to be gain-of-function and 13 predicted to be loss-of-function. Among 23 patients; 11 had Dravet Syndrome, 6 had early infantile developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, three had genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus spectrum disorder, one had self-limited familial neonatal-infantile epilepsy, one had self-limited infantile epilepsy and one had infantile childhood development epileptic encephalopathy. Our cohort consists of mainly SCN1 variants, most of them were predicted to be loss of function. Dravet syndrome was the most common phenotype. The prediction tool used in our study demonstrated overall compatibility with clinical findings. Due to the diverse clinical manifestations of variant functions, it may assist in guiding medication selection and predicting outcomes. We believe that such a tool will help the clinician in both prognosis prediction and solving therapeutic challenges in this group where refractory seizures are common.},

  abstract = {Ecstatic epilepsy is a rare form of focal epilepsy, so named because the seizures' first symptoms consist of an ecstatic/mystical experience, including feelings of increased self-awareness, mental clarity, and "unity with everything that exists," accompanied by a sense of bliss and physical well-being. In this perspective article, we first describe the phenomenology of ecstatic seizures, address their historical context, and describe the primary brain structure involved in the genesis of these peculiar epileptic seizures, the anterior insula. In the second part of the article, we move onto the possible neurocognitive underpinnings of ecstatic seizures. We first remind the reader of the insula's role in interoceptive processing and consciously experienced feelings, contextualized by the theory of predictive coding. This leads us to hypothesize that temporary disruptions to activity in the anterior insula could interrupt the generation of interoceptive prediction errors, and cause one to experience the absence of uncertainty, and thereby, a sense of bliss. The absence of interoceptive prediction errors would in fact mimic perfect prediction of the body's physiological state. This sudden clarity of bodily perception could explain the ecstatic quality of the experience, as the interoceptive system forms the basis for unified conscious experience. Our alternative hypothesis is that the anterior insula plays an overarching role in the processing of surprise and that the dysfunction caused by the epileptic discharge could interrupt any surprise exceeding expectations, resulting in a sense of complete control and oneness with the environment.},

This study aimed to develop and validate a novel prediction model combining clinical factors and radiomics features to accurately identify patients at high risk of developing PSE after intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH). Researchers performed a retrospective medical chart review to extract derivation and validation cohorts of patients with first-ever ICH that attended two tertiary hospitals in China between 2010 and 2020. Clinical data were extracted from electronic medical records and supplemented by tele-interview. Predictive clinical variables were selected by multivariable logistic regression to build the clinical model. Predictive radiomics features were identified, and a Rad-score was calculated according to the coefficient of the selected feature. Both clinical variables and radiomic features were combined to build the radiomics-clinical model. Performances of the clinical, Rad-score, and combined models were compared. A total of 1571 patients were included in the analysis. Cortical involvement, early seizures within 7 days of ICH, NIHSS score, and ICH volume were included in the clinical model. Rad-score, instead of ICH volume, was included in the combined model. The combined model exhibited better discrimination ability and achieved an overall better benefit against threshold probability than the clinical model in the decision curve analysis (DCA). The combined radiomics-clinical model was better able to predict ICH-associated PSE compared to the clinical model. This can help clinicians better predict an individual patient's risk of PSE following a first-ever ICH and facilitate earlier PSE diagnosis and treatment. • Radiomics has not been used in predicting the risk of developing PSE. • Higher Rad-scores were associated with higher risk of developing PSE. • The combined model showed better performance of PSE prediction ability.},

In presurgical work-up, intracranial EEG markers have been shown to be useful in identification of the seizure onset zone and prediction of post-surgical seizure freedom. However, in most cases, implantation of depth or subdural electrodes is performed, exposing patients to increased risks of complications. We analysed EEG data recorded from a minimally invasive approach utilizing foramen ovale (FO) and epidural peg electrodes using a supervised machine learning approach to predict post-surgical seizure freedom. Power-spectral EEG features were incorporated in a logistic regression model predicting one-year post-surgical seizure freedom. The prediction model was validated using repeated 5-fold cross-validation and compared to outcome prediction based on clinical and scalp EEG variables. Forty-seven patients (26 patients with post-surgical 1-year seizure freedom) were included in the study, with 31 having FO and 27 patients having peg onset seizures. The area under the receiver-operating curve for post-surgical seizure freedom (Engel 1A) prediction in patients with FO onset seizures was 0.74 ± 0.23 using electrophysiology features, compared to 0.66 ± 0.22 for predictions based on clinical and scalp EEG variables (p < 0.001). The most important features for prediction were spectral power in the gamma and high gamma ranges. EEG data from peg electrodes was not informative in predicting post-surgical outcomes. In this hypothesis-generating study, a data-driven approach based on EEG features derived from FO electrodes recordings outperformed the predictive ability based solely on clinical and scalp EEG variables. Pending validation in future studies, this method may provide valuable post-surgical prognostic information while minimizing risks of more invasive diagnostic approaches.},

  abstract = {Up to 35\% of individuals diagnosed with epilepsy continue to have seizures despite treatment, commonly referred to as drug-resistant epilepsy. Uncontrolled seizures can directly, or indirectly, negatively impact an individual's quality of life. To inform clinical management and life decisions, it is important to be able to predict the likelihood of seizure control. Those likely to achieve seizure control will be able to return sooner to their usual work and leisure activities and require less follow-up, whereas those with a poor prognosis will need more frequent clinical attendance and earlier consideration of epilepsy surgery. This is a systematic review aimed at identifying demographic, clinical, physiological (e.g., electroencephalographic), and imaging (e.g., magnetic resonance imaging) factors that may be predictive of treatment outcomes in patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy (NDE). MEDLINE and Embase were searched for prediction models of treatment outcomes in patients with NDE. Study characteristics were extracted and subjected to assessment of risk of bias (and applicability concerns) using the PROBAST (Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool) tool. Baseline variables associated with treatment outcomes are reported as prognostic factors. After screening, 48 models were identified in 32 studies, which generally scored low for concerns of applicability, but universally scored high for susceptibility to bias. Outcomes reported fit broadly into four categories: drug resistance, short-term treatment response, seizure remission, and mortality. Prognostic factors were also heterogenous, but the predictors that were commonly significantly associated with outcomes were those related to seizure characteristics/types, epilepsy history, and age at onset. Antiseizure medication response was often included as a baseline variable, potentially obscuring other factor relationships at baseline. Currently, outcome prediction models for NDE demonstrate a high risk of bias. Model development could be improved with a stronger adherence to recommended TRIPOD (Transparent Reporting of a Multivariable Prediction Model for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis) practices. Furthermore, we outline actionable changes to common practices that are intended to improve the overall quality of prediction model development in NDE.},

We are now witnessing the impact of these advances in our daily clinical practice. Thus, now is the time for a paradigm shift in epilepsy treatment from a reactive attitude, treating patients after the onset of epilepsy and the initiation of seizures, to a proactive attitude that is more broadly integrated into a 'P4 medicine' approach. This P4 approach, which is personalized, predictive, preventive and participatory, puts patients at the centre of their own care and, ultimately, aims to prevent the onset of epilepsy. This aim will be achieved by adapting epilepsy treatments not only to a given syndrome but also to a given patient and moving from the usual anti-seizure treatments to personalized treatments designed to target specific aetiologies. In this Review, we present the current state of this ongoing revolution, emphasizing the impact on clinical practice.},

About one-third of patients have drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). Surgery may be considered for selected patients, but time from diagnosis to surgery averages 20 years. We reviewed the potential use of machine learning (ML) predictive models as clinical decision support tools to help address some of these issues. We conducted a comprehensive search of Medline and Embase of studies that investigated the application of ML in epilepsy management in terms of predicting ASM responsiveness, predicting DRE, identifying surgical candidates, and predicting epilepsy surgery outcomes. Original articles addressing these 4 areas published in English between 2000 and 2020 were included. We identified 24 relevant articles: 6 on ASM responsiveness, 3 on DRE prediction, 2 on identifying surgical candidates, and 13 on predicting surgical outcomes. A variety of potential predictors were used including clinical, neuropsychological, imaging, electroencephalography, and health system claims data. A number of different ML algorithms and approaches were used for prediction, but only one study utilized deep learning methods. Some models show promising performance with areas under the curve above 0.9. However, most were single setting studies (18 of 24) with small sample sizes (median number of patients 55), with the exception of 3 studies that utilized large databases and 3 studies that performed external validation. There was a lack of standardization in reporting model performance. None of the models reviewed have been prospectively evaluated for their clinical benefits. The utility of ML models for clinical decision support in epilepsy management remains to be determined. Future research should be directed toward conducting larger studies with external validation, standardization of reporting, and prospective evaluation of the ML model on patient outcomes.},

Currently, the clinical decision process for selection of an antiepileptic drug (AED) is predominately based on the patient's epileptic syndrome and side effect profiles of the AEDs, but not on effectiveness data. Although standard dosages of AEDs are used, supplemented, in part, by therapeutic monitoring, the response of an individual patient to a specific AED is generally unpredictable, and the standard care of patients in antiepileptic treatment is more or less based on trial and error. Therefore, there is an urgent need for valid predictive biomarkers to guide patient-tailored individualized treatment strategies in epilepsy, a research area that is still in its infancy. This review focuses on genomic factors as part of an individual concept for AED therapy summarizing examples that influence the prognosis of the disease and the response to AEDs, including side effects.},

  abstract = {The ultimate seizure outcome of childhood epilepsy is complete resolution of all seizures without further treatment. How often this happens and how well it can be predicted early in the course of epilepsy could be valuable in helping families understand the nature of childhood epilepsy and what to expect over time. In the Connecticut study of epilepsy, a prospective cohort of 613 children with newly-diagnosed epilepsy (onset age 0-15 years), complete remission, ≥5 years both seizure-free and medication-free, was examined as a proxy of complete seizure resolution. Predictors at initial diagnosis were tested. Information about seizure outcomes within 2 years and from 2-5 years after diagnosis was sequentially added in a proportional hazards model. The predictive value of the models was determined with logistic regression. Five hundred and sixteen subjects were followed ≥10 years. Three hundred and twenty-eight (63\%) achieved complete remission; 23 relapsed. The relapse rate was 8.2 per 1000 person-years and decreased over time: 10.7, 6.7, and 0 during first 5 years, the next 5 years, and then >10 years after complete remission (P=0.06 for trend). Six participants regained complete remission; 311 (60\%) were in complete remission at last contact. Baseline factors predicting against complete remission at last contact included onset age≥10 years (hazard ratio=0.55, P=0.0009) and early school or developmental problems (hazard ratio=0.74, P=0.01). Factors predicting for complete remission were uncomplicated epilepsy presentation (hazard ratio=2.23, P<0.0001), focal self-limited epilepsy syndrome (hazard ratio=2.13, P<0.0001), and uncharacterized epilepsy (hazard ratio=1.61, P=0.04). Remission (hazard ratio=1.95, P<0.0001) and pharmaco-resistance (hazard ratio=0.33, P<0.0001) by 2 years respectfully predicted in favour and against complete remission. From 2 to 5 years after diagnosis, relapse (hazard ratio=0.21, P<0.0001) and late pharmaco-resistance (hazard ratio=0.21, P=0.008) decreased and late remission (hazard ratio=2.40, P<0.0001) increased chances of entering complete remission. The overall accuracy of the models increased from 72\% (baseline information only), to 77\% and 85\% with addition of 2-year and 5-year outcomes. Relapses after complete remission are rare making this an acceptable proxy for complete seizure resolution. Complete remission after nearly 20 years is reasonably well predicted within 5 years of initial diagnosis.},

  abstract = {This study was undertaken to expand the phenotypic and genetic spectrum of CLCN4-related epilepsy and to investigate genotype-phenotype correlations. We systematically reviewed the phenotypic and genetic spectrum of newly diagnosed and previously reported patients with CLCN4-related epilepsy. Three novel variants identified in four patients reported in this study were evaluated through in silico prediction and functional analysis by Western blot, immunofluorescence, and electrophysiological measurements. Epilepsy was diagnosed in 54.55\% (24/44) of individuals with CLCN4-related disorders and was drug-resistant in most cases. Of 24 patients, 15 had epileptic encephalopathy and four died at an early age; 69.57\% of patients had seizure onset within the first year of life. Myoclonic seizures are the most common seizure type, and 56.25\% of patients presented multiple seizure types. Notably, seizure outcome was favorable in individuals with only one seizure type. All patients showed intellectual disability, which was severe in 65.22\% of patients. Additional common features included language delay, behavioral disorders, and dysmorphic features. Five patients benefitted from treatment with lamotrigine. Most variants, which were mainly missense (79.17\%), were inherited (70.83\%). Whereas frameshift, intragenic deletion, or inherited variants were associated with milder phenotypes, missense or de novo variants led to more severe phenotypes. All evaluated CLCN4 variants resulted in loss of function with reduced ClC-4 currents. Nonetheless, genotype-phenotype relationships for CLCN4-related epilepsy are not straightforward, as phenotypic variability was observed in recurrent variants and within single families. Pathogenic CLCN4 variants contribute significantly to the genetic etiology of epilepsy. The phenotypic spectrum of CLCN4-related epilepsy includes drug-resistant seizures, cognitive and language impairment, behavioral disorders, and congenital anomalies. Notably, the mutation type and the number of seizure types correlate with the severity of the phenotype, suggesting its use for clinical prognosis. Lamotrigine can be considered a therapeutic option.},

  abstract = {Epilepsy is the second most common neurological disorder, affecting 0.6-0.8\% of the world's population. In this neurological disorder, abnormal activity of the brain causes seizures, the nature of which tend to be sudden. Antiepileptic Drugs (AEDs) are used as long-term therapeutic solutions that control the condition. Of those treated with AEDs, 35\% become resistant to medication. The unpredictable nature of seizures poses risks for the individual with epilepsy. It is clearly desirable to find more effective ways of preventing seizures for such patients. The automatic detection of oncoming seizures, before their actual onset, can facilitate timely intervention and hence minimize these risks. In addition, advance prediction of seizures can enrich our understanding of the epileptic brain. In this study, drawing on the body of work behind automatic seizure detection and prediction from digitised Invasive Electroencephalography (EEG) data, a prediction algorithm, ASPPR (Advance Seizure Prediction via Pre-ictal Relabeling), is described. ASPPR facilitates the learning of predictive models targeted at recognizing patterns in EEG activity that are in a specific time window in advance of a seizure. It then exploits advanced machine learning coupled with the design and selection of appropriate features from EEG signals. Results, from evaluating ASPPR independently on 21 different patients, suggest that seizures for many patients can be predicted up to 20 minutes in advance of their onset. Compared to benchmark performance represented by a mean S1-Score (harmonic mean of Sensitivity and Specificity) of 90.6\% for predicting seizure onset between 0 and 5 minutes in advance, ASPPR achieves mean S1-Scores of: 96.30\% for prediction between 1 and 6 minutes in advance, 96.13\% for prediction between 8 and 13 minutes in advance, 94.5\% for prediction between 14 and 19 minutes in advance, and 94.2\% for prediction between 20 and 25 minutes in advance.},

  abstract = {Despite numerous investigations into the relationship between physical activities (PA) and epilepsy, the causal effects remain contentious. Thus, we conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study to assess the potential causality. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) predisposed to self-reported moderate and vigorous physical activities (MPA and VPA) and overall acceleration average (OAA) calculated through wrist-worn accelerometers were selected as exposure instrumental variables. Five subtypes of epilepsy, including all epilepsy, focal epilepsy and generalized epilepsy (with or without each other), focal epilepsy-strict definition and generalized epilepsy-strict definition (without overlap), were chosen as the outcomes. The MR study utilized the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method as the primary analytical tool, supplemented by MR-Egger, simple mode, weighted mode, and weighted median methods. Cochran's Q and MR-Egger intercept tests were employed to assess heterogeneity and pleiotropy, while MR pleiotropy residual sum and outlier and leave-one-out analyses were conducted to identify potential SNP outliers. The study indicated that OAA was genetically linked to a decreased risk of both focal epilepsy (OR = 0.812, 95\% CI: 0.687-0.960, p = .015, IVW) and focal epilepsy-strict definition (OR = 0.732, 95\% CI: 0.596-0.900, p = .003, IVW; OR = 0.749, 95\% CI: 0.573-0.979, p = .035, Weighted median). Genetically predicted MPA and VPA did not exhibit a causal association with all epilepsy or its subtypes (p>.05). No evidence of heterogeneity, pleiotropy, or SNP outlier was observed. Our findings suggested that PA with accelerometer monitoring may potentially reduce the risk of focal epilepsy, while there is no evidence supporting causal association between self-reported MPA or VPA and either focal or generalized epilepsy.},

The aim of this study was to develop and validate a supervised machine learning (ML) model for predicting seizure freedom after pediatric epilepsy surgery. This is a multicenter retrospective study of children who underwent epilepsy surgery at five pediatric epilepsy centers in North America. Clinical information, diagnostic investigations, and surgical characteristics were collected, and used as features to predict seizure-free outcome 1 year after surgery. The dataset was split randomly into 80\% training and 20\% testing data. Thirty-five combinations of five feature sets with seven ML classifiers were assessed on the training cohort using 10-fold cross-validation for model development. The performance of the optimal combination of ML classifier and feature set was evaluated in the testing cohort, and compared with logistic regression, a classical statistical approach. Of the 801 patients included, 61.3\% were seizure-free 1 year postsurgery. During model development, the best combination was XGBoost ML algorithm with five features from the univariate feature set, including number of antiseizure medications, magnetic resonance imaging lesion, age at seizure onset, video-electroencephalography concordance, and surgery type, with a mean area under the curve (AUC) of .73 (95\% confidence interval [CI] = .69-.77). The combination of XGBoost and univariate feature set was then evaluated on the testing cohort and achieved an AUC of .74 (95\% CI = .66-.82; sensitivity = .87, 95\% CI = .81-.94; specificity = .58, 95\% CI = .47-.71). The XGBoost model outperformed the logistic regression model (AUC = .72, 95\% CI = .63-.80; sensitivity = .72, 95\% CI = .63-.82; specificity = .66, 95\% CI = .53-.77) in the testing cohort (p = .005). This study identified important features and validated an ML algorithm, XGBoost, for predicting the probability of seizure freedom after pediatric epilepsy surgery. Improved prognostication of epilepsy surgery is critical for presurgical counseling and will inform treatment decisions.},

The current study evaluated the use of keyword search as an alternative method for rare epilepsy cohort creation using electronic health records data. Data included clinical notes from encounters with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes for seizures, epilepsy, and/or convulsions during 2010-2014, across six health care systems in New York City. We identified cases with rare epilepsies by searching clinical notes for keywords associated with 33 rare epilepsies. We validated cases via manual chart review. We compared the performance of keyword search to manual chart review using positive predictive value (PPV), sensitivity, and F-score. We selected an initial combination of keywords using the highest F-scores. Data included clinical notes from 77 924 cases with ICD-9 codes for seizures, epilepsy, and/or convulsions. The all-keyword search method identified 6095 candidates, and manual chart review confirmed that 2068 (34\%) had a rare epilepsy. The initial combination method identified 1862 cases with a rare epilepsy, and this method performed as follows: PPV median = .64 (interquartile range [IQR] = .50-.81, range = .20-1.00), sensitivity median = .93 (IQR = .76-1.00, range = .10-1.00), and F-score median = .71 (IQR = .63-.85, range = .18-1.00). Using this method, we identified four cohorts of rare epilepsies with over 100 individuals, including infantile spasms, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, Rett syndrome, and tuberous sclerosis complex. We identified over 50 individuals with two rare epilepsies that do not have specific ICD-10 codes for cohort creation (epilepsy with myoclonic atonic seizures, Sturge-Weber syndrome). Keyword search is an effective method for cohort creation. These findings can improve identification and surveillance of individuals with rare epilepsies and promote their referral to specialty clinics, clinical research, and support groups.},

Clinical variables, EEG, brain MRI, genetic results, medical and non-medical treatment were compared between 156 children with both epilepsy and autism, 156 randomly selected and 156 demographically matched children with epilepsy only. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine predictors of drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). As compared to the'matched' cohort, more patients with autism had generalized motor seizures although not statistically significant after Benjamini-Hochberg correction (54.5\%, vs 42.3\%, p = .0314); they had a lower rate of electroclinical syndromes (12.8\%, vs 30.1\%, p = .0002). There were more incidental MRI findings but less positive MRI findings to explain their epilepsy in children with autism (26.3\%, vs 13.8\% and 14.3\%, vs 34.2\%, respectively; p = .0003). In addition, LEV, LTG, and VPA were the most common ASMs prescribed to children with autism, as opposed to LEV, OXC, and LTG in children without autism. No difference in the major EEG abnormalities was observed. Although the rates of DRE were similar (24.8\%, vs 26.6\%, p = .7203), we identified two clinical and five electrographic correlates with DRE in children with both epilepsy and autism and a final prediction modeling of DRE that included EEG ictal findings, focal onset seizures, generalized motor seizures, abnormal EEG background, age of epilepsy onset, and history of SE, which were distinct from those in children without autism. Our study indicates that detailed seizure history and EEG findings are the most important evaluation and prediction tools for the development of DRE in children with epilepsy and co-occurring autism. Further studies of epilepsy in specific autism subgroups based on their etiology and clinical severity are warranted.},

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays a central role in detecting epileptogenic brain lesions.

MRI is a mandatory investigation for diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy, particularly when surgery is being considered. Continuous progress in imaging techniques, combined with machine learning, will continue to push the boundaries of lesion visibility and provide increasingly precise predictors of clinical outcomes.

Using certain alert symptoms (i.e., auras, prodromes, precipitant factors), patients can adopt behaviors to avoid injury during and after the seizure or may implement spontaneous cognitive and emotional strategies to try to control the seizure itself. From the patient's view point, potential means of enhancing seizure prediction and developing seizure control supports are seen as very important issues, especially when the epilepsy is drug-resistant. In this review, we first describe how some patients anticipate their seizures and whether this is effective in terms of seizure prediction. Secondly, we examine how these anticipatory elements might help patients to prevent or control their seizures and how the patient's neuropsychological profile, specifically parameters of perceived self-control (PSC) and locus of control (LOC), might impact these strategies and quality of life (QOL). Thirdly, we review the external supports that can help patients to better predict seizures. Finally, we look at nonpharmacological means of increasing perceived self-control and achieving potential reduction of seizure frequency (i.e., stress-based and arousal-based strategies). In the past few years, various approaches for detection and control of seizures have gained greater interest, but more research is needed to confirm a positive effect on seizure frequency as well as on QOL.},

Our results showed an average sensitivity of 86.7\% and 92.9\%, an average false prediction rate of 0.126 and 0.096/h, and an average minimum prediction time of 14.3 and 33.3min, respectively, using seizure occurrence periods of 30 and 50min and a seizure prediction horizon of 10s. Two-third of the analyzed seizures showed significantly increased complexity in periods prior to the seizures in comparison with baseline. In four patients, strong bidirectional connectivities between epileptic contacts and the surrounding areas were observed. However, in five patients, unidirectional functional connectivities in preictal periods were observed from remote areas to epileptogenic zones. Overall, preictal periods in patients with focal hippocampal epilepsy were characterized with patient-specific changes in univariate and bivariate nonlinear measures. The spatio-temporal characterization of preictal periods may help to better understand the mechanism underlying seizure generation in patients with focal hippocampal epilepsy.},

  abstract = {In contrast to short-term cognitive outcomes, long-term cognitive outcomes (over 5 years) has been scarcely assessed so far. Yet, predicting long-term outcomes at any time point of the epilepsy, from initial diagnosis, to medically intractability is very important for therapeutic decision-making, patient information, and orientation. Assessing long-term cognitive outcomes in patients with epilepsy would ideally require longitudinal studies and a comparison with a healthy controls group. This issue has been addressed extensively, but with controversial results. However, there is a general consensus about the fact that cognitive outcome is not the same in all groups of patients with epilepsy. Possible prognostic factors include age at onset, duration of epilepsy, syndrome and etiology, seizure outcome and therapeutics. The multiplicity of factors makes it very difficult to assess their relative weight in individuals. Although long-term cognitive outcome studies are scarce, this issue has been specifically studied in newly diagnosed epilepsies and in focal drug-resistant epilepsies. In the first clinical setting, i.e. newly diagnosed epilepsy, it appears that cognitive deficits are already present at epilepsy onset in a significant proportion of patients but seem to remain stable over time. In focal drug-resistant epilepsies, cognitive deficits (mainly verbal memory) were generally shown to remain stable provided that seizures were controlled either by medication or by surgery. Beyond the possible correlation between seizure and cognitive outcome, no causal link however has been demonstrated between these two important outcomes.},

We use the data to further develop a nomogram to predict seizure freedom. We retrospectively reviewed the scalp EEG findings and clinical data of patients who underwent surgical resection at three epilepsy centers. Using both EEG and clinical variables categorized into 13 isolated candidate predictors and 6 interaction terms, we built a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model to predict seizure freedom 2 years after surgery. Harrell's step-down procedure was used to sequentially eliminate the least-informative variables from the model until the change in the concordance index (c-index) with variable removal was less than 0.01. We created a separate model using only clinical variables. Discrimination of the two models was compared to evaluate the role of scalp EEG in seizure-freedom prediction. Four hundred seventy patient records were analyzed. Following internal validation, the full Clinical + EEG model achieved an optimism-corrected c-index of 0.65, whereas the c-index of the model without EEG data was 0.59. The presence of focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures (FBTCS), high preoperative seizure frequency, absence of hippocampal sclerosis, and presence of nonlocalizable seizures predicted worse outcome. The presence of FBTCS had the largest impact for predicting outcome. The analysis of the models' interactions showed that in patients with unilateral interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs), temporal lobe surgery cases had a better outcome. In cases with bilateral IEDs, abnormal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) predicted worse outcomes, and in cases without IEDs, patients with extratemporal epilepsy and abnormal MRI had better outcomes. This study highlights the value of scalp EEG, particularly the significance of IEDs, in predicting surgical outcome. The nomogram delivers an individualized prediction of postoperative outcome, and provides a unique assessment of the relationship between the outcome and preoperative findings.},

  abstract = {Epilepsy is characterized by transient alterations in brain synchronization resulting in seizures with a wide spectrum of manifestations. Seizure severity and risks for patients depend on the evolution and spread of the hypersynchronous discharges. With standard visual inspection and pattern classification, this evolution could not be predicted early on. It is still unclear to what degree the seizure onset zone determines seizure severity. Such information would improve our understanding of ictal epileptic activity and the existing electroencephalogram (EEG)-based warning and intervention systems, providing specific reactions to upcoming seizure types. We investigate the possibility of predicting the future development of an epileptic seizure during the first seconds of recordings after their electrographic onset. Based on intracranial EEG recordings of 493 ictal events from 26 patients with focal epilepsy, a set of 25 time and frequency domain features was computed using nonoverlapping 1-second time windows, from the first 3, 5, and 10 seconds of ictal EEG. Three random forest classifiers were trained to predict the future evolution of the seizure, distinguishing between subclinical events, focal onset aware and impaired awareness, and focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures. Results show that early seizure type prediction is possible based on a single EEG channel located in the seizure onset zone with correct prediction rates of 76.2 ± 14.5\% for distinguishing subclinical electrographic events from clinically manifest seizures, 75 ± 16.8\% for distinguishing focal onset seizures that are or are not bilateral tonic-clonic, and 71.4 ± 17.2\% for distinguishing between focal onset seizures with or without impaired awareness. All predictions are above the chance level (P < .01). These findings provide the basis for developing systems for specific early warning of patients and health care providers, and for targeting EEG-based closed-loop intervention approaches to electrographic patterns with a high inherent risk to become clinically manifest.},

The study included 98 patients diagnosed with developmental and epileptic encephalopathies. The patients underwent Sanger sequencing of SCN1A, Chromosomal Microarray Analysis, and Whole Exome Sequencing. The association of clinical variables with a positive genetic test was investigated using univariate and multivariate analysis. Genetic diagnosis was identified in 47 (48 \%) patients with developmental and epileptic encephalopathies. Beyond Dravet Syndrome influence, first seizure in the context of fever (p < 0.01), seizures precipitated by temperature (p = 0.04), cognitive regression (p = 0.04), hypotonia (p < 0.01), and focal seizures (p = 0.03) increased the chances of a positive genetic investigation. In contrast, atonic seizures (p = 0.01) and generalized discharges on electroencephalogram (p = 0.02) decreased the chances. Dravet Syndrome was positively associated with a genetic developmental and epileptic encephalopathies etiology (p < 0.01), whereas epilepsy with myoclonic-atonic seizures (p = 0.01), developmental and epileptic encephalopathies with spike-wave activation in sleep (p = 0.04), and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (p = 0.03) were negatively associated. In multivariate analysis, the first seizure in the context of fever (p < 0.01) and hypotonia (p = 0.02) were positively, and atonic seizures (p = 0.01) were negatively and independently associated with a genetic etiology. The predictive variables of genetic investigation in developmental and epileptic encephalopathies are first seizure in the context of fever and hypotonia, whereas atonic seizures decrease the chances of finding a genetic cause for developmental and epileptic encephalopathies. Regarding epileptic syndromes, Dravet Syndrome is highly associated with a positive genetic test, whereas epilepsy with myoclonic-atonic seizures, developmental and epileptic encephalopathies with spike-wave activation in sleep, and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome are rarely associated with a positive genetic investigation.},

  abstract = {Direct cortical stimulation has been applied in epilepsy for nearly a century and has experienced a renaissance, given unprecedented opportunities to probe, excite, and inhibit the human brain. Evidence suggests stimulation can increase diagnostic and therapeutic utility in patients with drug-resistant epilepsies. However, choosing appropriate stimulation parameters is not a trivial issue, and is further complicated by epilepsy being characterized by complex brain state dynamics. In this article derived from discussions at the ICTALS 2022 Conference (International Conference on Technology and Analysis for Seizures), we succinctly review the literature on cortical stimulation applied acutely and chronically to the epileptic brain for localization, monitoring, and therapeutic purposes. In particular, we discuss how stimulation is used to probe brain excitability, discuss evidence on the usefulness of stimulation to trigger and stop seizures, review therapeutic applications of stimulation, and finally discuss how stimulation parameters are impacted by brain dynamics. Although research has advanced considerably over the past decade, there are still significant hurdles to optimizing use of this technique. For example, it remains unclear to what extent short timescale diagnostic biomarkers can predict long-term outcomes and to what extent these biomarkers add information to already existing biomarkers from passive electroencephalographic recordings. Further questions include the extent to which closed loop stimulation offers advantages over open loop stimulation, what the optimal closed loop timescales may be, and whether biomarker-informed stimulation can lead to seizure freedom. The ultimate goal of bioelectronic medicine remains not just to stop seizures but rather to cure epilepsy and its comorbidities.},

A number of TMS-electromyography (EMG) and TMS-electroencephalography (EEG) studies have identified distinct changes of cortical excitability associated with specific epilepsy syndromes and in asymptomatic siblings of patients with epilepsy. Pharmaco-TMS studies have shed additional light on the effects of traditional and recently introduced antiepileptic drugs on excitatory and inhibitory brain microcircuits as well as cortical plasticity mechanisms. In addition, stronger evidence has emerged that TMS may serve as a biomarker with prognostic (i.e. predicting response to pharmacologic or surgical interventions) and diagnostic potential (for instance aiding in the noninvasive localization of the epileptogenic zone). Finally, the role of repetitive TMS in the therapeutic management of drug-resistant epilepsies and refractory status epilepticus has been further defined and is expected to become more prominent by the optimization of the stimulation parameters. TMS has provided important insight into the pathophysiological substrate of human epilepsies and emerges as a valuable tool with diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic potential. The recent advent of TMS-EEG can be reasonably expected to contribute further significant advances to the field of epilepsy.},

We evaluated whether defining abnormal HFO rates by statistical comparison to region-specific physiological HFO rates observed in the healthy brain improves identification of the epileptic focus and surgical outcome prediction. We detected HFOs in 151 consecutive patients who underwent stereo-electroencephalography and subsequent resective epilepsy surgery at two tertiary epilepsy centers. We compared how HFOs identified the resection cavity and predicted seizure-free outcome using two thresholds from the literature (HFO rate > 1/min; 50\% of the total number of a patient's HFOs) and three thresholds based on normative rates from the Montreal Neurological Institute Open iEEG Atlas (https://mni-open-ieegatlas. mcgill.ca/): global Atlas threshold, regional Atlas threshold, and regional + 10\% threshold after regional Atlas correction. Using ripples, the regional + 10\% threshold performed best for focus identification (77.3\% accuracy, 27\% sensitivity, 97.1\% specificity, 80.6\% positive predictive value [PPV], 78.2\% negative predictive value [NPV]) and outcome prediction (69.5\% accuracy, 58.6\% sensitivity, 76.3\% specificity, 60.7\% PPV, 74.7\% NPV). This was an improvement for focus identification (+1.1\% accuracy, +17.0\% PPV; p < .001) and outcome prediction (+12.0\% sensitivity, +1.0\% PPV; p = .05) compared to the 50\% threshold. The improvement was particularly marked for foci in cortex, where physiological ripples are frequent (outcome: +35.3\% sensitivity, +5.3\% PPV; p = .014). In these cases, the regional + 10\% threshold outperformed fast ripple rate > 1/min (+3.6\% accuracy, +26.5\% sensitivity, +21.6\% PPV; p < .001) and seizure onset zone (+13.5\% accuracy, +29.4\% sensitivity, +17.0\% PPV; p < .05-.01) for outcome prediction. Normalization did not improve the performance of fast ripples. Defining abnormal HFO rates by statistical comparison to rates in healthy tissue overcomes an important weakness in the clinical use of ripples. It improves focus identification and outcome prediction compared to standard HFO measures, increasing their clinical applicability.},

We aim to assess the localizing and lateralizing value as well as prognostic significance of fear aura in patients with focal epilepsy. The occurrence of fear aura in relation to epileptogenic origin and its association with postoperative outcome were analyzed in 146 consecutive patients undergoing resective surgery for intractable epilepsy. Ninety-four (64.4\%) patients reported auras, and 31 (21.2\%) reported fear aura in their seizures. One hundred ten (75.3\%) patients had an Engel class I outcome until last follow-up, of whom 24 experienced fear aura preoperatively. Fear aura appeared more frequently during temporal and frontal lobe seizures, but did not lateralize the seizure onset zone. There were no significant baseline differences between patients with and without fear aura. No correlation was found between postoperative outcome and the presence of auras. Occurrence of fear aura failed to show predictive value in surgical outcome whether in pooled or subgroup analysis. This study advances our understanding of the origin of fear aura, and is helpful for presurgical evaluation and outcome prediction. Without lateralizing value, fear aura is more commonly seen with temporal or frontal origin. When taken as a whole, auras do not have a significant impact on seizure outcome in focal epilepsy. Patients with fear aura are no more likely to become seizure-free than those without fear aura.},

We evaluated two algorithms on three datasets by computing the correlation of false predictions and estimating the information transfer between both classification methods. For 9 out of 12 individuals both methods showed a performance better than chance. For all individuals we observed a positive correlation in predictions. For individuals with strong correlation in false predictions we were able to boost the performance of one method by excluding test samples based on the results of the second method. Substantially different algorithms exhibit a highly consistent performance and a strong coherency in false and missing alarms. Hence, changing the underlying hypothesis of a preictal state of fixed time length prior to each seizure to a proictal state is more helpful than further optimizing classifiers. The outcome is significant for the evaluation of seizure prediction algorithms on continuous data.},

Early targeted interventions increase the probability of seizure-freedom and may protect neurodevelopment. In 2012, clinical recommendations for the management of epilepsy in patients with TSC were published by a panel of European experts. Since that time novel studies, reports, and expert opinions in preclinical and clinical TSC-related sciences prompted the need for updated recommendations, including epileptogenesis in TSC, the potential role of predictive biomarkers, the possible benefits of presymptomatic diagnosis and preventive treatment, and new treatment options including mTOR inhibitors. A reconvened panel reviewed the current literature to answer specific questions and five panelists discussed the findings, followed by a general discussion during which all issues were debated to achieve consensus regarding recommendations. A draft manuscript based on these discussions and recommendations was then circulated several times among the panelists, who added their own comments. All the panelists/authors agreed with the final manuscript, which was then submitted for publication. The panel concluded that the need for early diagnosis of TSC-associated seizures is now established, electroencephalographic monitoring has good predictive value for epilepsy before seizure onset in TSC, and, until conclusive data from the EPISTOP trial are available, administration of vigabatrin may be considered in children with subclinical epileptiform EEG discharges. The panel also supported the role of adjunctive everolimus for TSC-associated drug-refractory seizures and emphasized the necessity of early surgical evaluation.},

Identifying recurrent "premonitory" symptoms of seizures and using them to recalibrate seizure prediction algorithms may improve prediction performances.

Through an online survey, demographics and clinical characteristics (e.g., seizure frequency, epilepsy duration, and postictal symptom duration) were collected from people with epilepsy and caregivers across Canada. Respondents were asked to answer questions regarding their ability to predict seizures through warning symptoms. A total of 196 patients and 150 caregivers were included and were separated into three groups: those who reported warning symptoms within the 5 minutes preceding a seizure, prodromes (symptoms earlier than 5 minutes before seizure), and no warning symptoms. Overall, 12.2\% of patients and 12.0\% of caregivers reported predictive prodromes ranging from 5 minutes to more than 24 hours before the seizures (median of 2 hours). The most common were dizziness/vertigo (28\%), mood changes (26\%), and cognitive changes (21\%). Statistical testing showed that respondents who reported prodromes also reported significantly longer postictal recovery periods compared to those who did not report predictive prodromes ( Findings suggest that patients who present predictive seizure prodromes may be characterized by longer patient-reported postictal recovery periods. Studying the correlation between seizure severity and predictability and investigating the electrical activity underlying prodromes may improve our understanding of preictal mechanisms and ability to predict seizures.},

A neurologist reviewed electronic health record data to assess epilepsy status in a stratified random sample of Medicare beneficiaries aged 65+ years between January 2012 and December 2014. We then reconstructed the full sample using inverse probability sampling weights. We developed prediction models using longitudinal Medicare data, then in a separate sample evaluated the predictive performance of each model, for example, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), sensitivity, and specificity. Of 20,945 patients in the reconstructed sample, 2.1\% had confirmed epilepsy.

  abstract = {An early genetic diagnosis can guide the time-sensitive treatment of individuals with genetic epilepsies. However, most genetic diagnoses occur long after disease onset. We aimed to identify early clinical features suggestive of genetic diagnoses in individuals with epilepsy through large-scale analysis of full-text electronic medical records. We extracted 89 million time-stamped standardized clinical annotations using Natural Language Processing from 4,572,783 clinical notes from 32,112 individuals with childhood epilepsy, including 1925 individuals with known or presumed genetic epilepsies. We applied these features to train random forest models to predict SCN1A-related disorders and any genetic diagnosis. We identified 47,774 age-dependent associations of clinical features with genetic etiologies a median of 3.6 years before molecular diagnosis. Across all 710 genetic etiologies identified in our cohort, neurodevelopmental differences between 6 to 9 months increased the likelihood of a later molecular diagnosis 5-fold (P < .0001, 95\% CI = 3.55-7.42). A later diagnosis of SCN1A-related disorders (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.91) or an overall positive genetic diagnosis (AUC = 0.82) could be reliably predicted using random forest models. Clinical features predictive of genetic epilepsies precede molecular diagnoses by up to several years in conditions with known precision treatments. An earlier diagnosis facilitated by automated electronic medical records analysis has the potential for earlier targeted therapeutic strategies in the genetic epilepsies.},

  abstract = {Resective surgery is the treatment of choice for one-third of adult patients with focal, drug-resistant epilepsy. This procedure is associated with substantial clinical and cognitive risks. In clinical practice, there is no validated model for epilepsy surgery outcome prediction (ESOP). Meta-analyses on ESOP studies assessing prognostic factors report discrepancies in terms of study design. Our review aims to systematically investigate methodological and analytical aspects of studies predicting clinical and cognitive outcomes after temporal lobe epilepsy surgery. A systematic review of ESOP studies published between 2000 and 2022 from three databases (MEDLINE, Web of Science, and PsycINFO) was completed by following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. It yielded 4867 articles. Among them, 21 corresponded to our inclusion criteria and were therefore retained in the final review. The risk of bias was assessed using A Tool to Assess Risk of Bias and Applicability of Prediction Model Studies (PROBAST). Data extracted from the 21 studies were analyzed using narrative synthesis and descriptive statistics. Our findings show an increase in the use of multimodal datasets and machine learning analyses in recent ESOP studies, although regression remained the most frequently used approach. We also identified a more frequent use of network notions in recent ESOP studies. Nevertheless, several methodological issues were noted, such as small sample sizes, lack of information on the follow-up period, variability in seizure outcome, and the definition of neuropsychological postoperative change. Of 21 studies, only one provided a clinical tool to anticipate the cognitive outcome after epilepsy surgery. We conclude that methodological issues should be overcome before we move towards more complete models to better predict clinical and cognitive outcomes after epilepsy surgery. Recommendations for future studies to harness the possibilities of multimodal datasets and data fusion, are provided. A stronger bridge between fundamental and clinical research may result in developing accessible clinical tools.},

  abstract = {The sudden and apparently unpredictable nature of seizures is one of the most disabling aspects of the disease epilepsy. A method capable of predicting the occurrence of seizures from the electroencephalogram (EEG) of epilepsy patients would open new therapeutic possibilities. Since the 1970s investigations on the predictability of seizures have advanced from preliminary descriptions of seizure precursors to controlled studies applying prediction algorithms to continuous multi-day EEG recordings. While most of the studies published in the 1990s and around the turn of the millennium yielded rather promising results, more recent evaluations could not reproduce these optimistic findings, thus raising a debate about the validity and reliability of previous investigations. In this review, we will critically discuss the literature on seizure prediction and address some of the problems and pitfalls involved in the designing and testing of seizure-prediction algorithms. We will give an account of the current state of this research field, point towards possible future developments and propose methodological guidelines for future studies on seizure prediction.},

This study investigated MRI radiomics features, tumor location, voxel-based morphometry (VBM) for gray matter density, and tumor volumetry to differentiate between children with low grade glioma (LGG)-associated epilepsies and those without, and further identified key radiomics features for predicting of epilepsy risk in children with supratentorial LGG to construct an epilepsy prediction model. A total of 206 radiomics features of tumors and voxel-based morphometric analysis of tumor location features were extracted from T2-FLAIR images in a primary cohort of 48 children with LGG with epilepsy (N = 23) or without epilepsy (N = 25), prior to surgery. Feature selection was performed using the minimum redundancy maximum relevance algorithm, and leave-one-out cross-validation was applied to assess the predictive performance of radiomics and tumor location signatures in differentiating epilepsy-associated LGG from non-epilepsy cases. Voxel-based morphometric analysis showed significant positive t-scores within bilateral temporal cortex and negative t-scores in basal ganglia between epilepsy and non-epilepsy groups. Eight radiomics features were identified as significant predictors of epilepsy in LGG, encompassing characteristics of 2 locations, 2 shapes, 1 image gray scale intensity, and 3 textures. The most important predictor was temporal lobe involvement, followed by high dependence high grey level emphasis, elongation, area density, information correlation 1, midbrain and intensity range. The Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) model yielded the best prediction performance, when implemented with a combination of radiomics features and tumor location features, as evidenced by the following metrics: precision (0.955), recall (0.913), specificity (0.960), accuracy (0.938), F-1 score (0.933), and area under curve (AUC) (0.950). Our findings demonstrated the efficacy of machine learning models based on radiomics features and voxel-based anatomical locations in predicting the risk of epilepsy in supratentorial LGG. This model provides a highly accurate tool for distinguishing epilepsy-associated LGG in children, supporting precise treatment planning. Not applicable.},

  abstract = {Epilepsy is a serious complication after an ischemic stroke. Although two studies have developed prediction model for post-stroke epilepsy (PSE), their accuracy remains insufficient, and their applicability to different populations is uncertain. With the rapid advancement of computer technology, machine learning (ML) offers new opportunities for creating more accurate prediction models. However, the potential of ML in predicting PSE is still not well understood. The purpose of this study was to develop prediction models for PSE among ischemic stroke patients. Patients with ischemic stroke from two stroke centers were included in this retrospective cohort study. At the baseline level, 33 input variables were considered candidate features. The 2-year PSE prediction models in the derivation cohort were built using six ML algorithms. The predictive performance of these machine learning models required further appraisal and comparison with the reference model using the conventional triage classification information. The Shapley additive explanation (SHAP), based on fair profit allocation among many stakeholders according to their contributions, is used to interpret the predicted outcomes of the naive Bayes (NB) model. A total of 1977 patients were included to build the predictive model for PSE. The Boruta method identified NIHSS score, hospital length of stay, D-dimer level, and cortical involvement as the optimal features, with the receiver operating characteristic curves ranging from 0.709 to 0.849. An additional 870 patients were used to validate the ML and reference models. The NB model achieved the best performance among the PSE prediction models with an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.757. At the 20 \% absolute risk threshold, the NB model also provided a sensitivity of 0.739 and a specificity of 0.720. The reference model had poor sensitivities of only 0.15 despite achieving a helpful AUC of 0.732. Furthermore, the SHAP method analysis demonstrated that a higher NIHSS score, longer hospital length of stay, higher D-dimer level, and cortical involvement were positive predictors of epilepsy after ischemic stroke. Our study confirmed the feasibility of applying the ML method to use easy-to-obtain variables for accurate prediction of PSE and provided improved strategies and effective resource allocation for high-risk patients. In addition, the SHAP method could improve model transparency and make it easier for clinicians to grasp the prediction model's reliability.},

To cure epilepsy and control seizures requires a paradigm shift in the development of new approaches to epilepsy diagnosis and treatment. Contemporary medicine has benefited from the exponential growth of computational modeling, and the application of network dynamics theory to understanding and treating human brain disorders. In epilepsy, the introduction of these approaches has led to personalized epileptic network modeling that can explore the patient's seizure genesis and predict the functional impact of resection on its individual network's propensity to seize. The application of the dynamic systems approach to neurostimulation therapy of epilepsy allows designing stimulation strategies that consider the patient's seizure dynamics and long-term fluctuations in the stability of their epileptic networks. In this article, we review, in a nontechnical fashion suitable for a broad neuroscientific audience, recent progress in personalized dynamic brain network modeling that is shaping the future approach to the diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy.},

The prevalence of such neurobehavioral abnormalities as cognitive and mood disorders, autism spectrum disorder, and attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is significantly higher among patients with epilepsy than in the general population. A long-held view that comorbidities of epilepsy represent mere epiphenomena of seizures has undergone substantial transformation during the past decade, as emerging clinical evidence and experimental evidence suggest the involvement of specific neurobiological mechanisms in the evolution of neurobehavioral deficits in patients with epilepsy. Developmental aspects of both epilepsy and its comorbidities, as well as the frequently reported reciprocal connection between these disorders, both add other dimensions to the already complex problem. In light of progress in effective seizure management in many patients with epilepsy, the importance of neurobehavioral comorbidities has become acute, as the latter are frequently more detrimental to patients' quality of life compared with seizures. This calls for a serious increase in efforts to effectively predict, manage, and ideally cure these comorbidities. Coordinated multicenter clinical, translational, and basic research studies focusing on epidemiology, neuropsychology, neurophysiology, imaging, genetics, epigenetics, and pharmacology of neurobehavioral comorbidities of epilepsy are absolutely instrumental for ensuring tangible progress in the field. Clinical research should focus more on new-onset epilepsy and put particular emphasis on longitudinal studies in large cohorts of patients and groups at risk, while translational research should primarily focus on the development of valid preclinical systems which would allow investigating the fundamental mechanism of epilepsy comorbidities. The final goal of the described research efforts would lie in producing an armamentarium of evidence-based diagnostic tools and therapeutic interventions which would at minimum mitigate and at maximum prevent or abolish neurobehavioral comorbidities of epilepsy and, thus, improve the quality of life of those patients with epilepsy who suffer from the said comorbidities.},

  abstract = {This overview covers recent advances in the field of EEG/MEG signal processing and modeling in epilepsy regarding both interictal and ictal phenomena. In the first part, the main methods used in the analysis of interictal EEG/MEG epileptiform spikes are presented and discussed. Source and volume conductor models are passed in review, namely the equivalent dipole source concept, the requirements for adequate time and spatial sampling, the question of how to validate source solutions, particularly by comparing solutions obtained using scalp and intracranial EEG signals, EEG \& MEG data, or EEG simultaneously recorded with fMRI (BOLD signals). In the second part, methods used for the characterization of seizures are considered, namely dipolar modeling of spikes at seizure onset, decomposition of seizure EEG signals into sets of orthogonal spatio-temporal components, and also methods (linear and nonlinear) of estimating seizure propagation. In the third part, the crucial issue of how the transition between interictal and seizure activity takes place is examined. In particular the vicissitudes of the efforts along the road to seizure prediction are shortly reviewed. It is argued that this question can be reduced to the problem of estimating the excitability state of neuronal populations in the course of time as a seizure approaches. The value of active probing methods in contrast with passive analytical methods is emphasized. In the fourth part modeling aspects are considered in the light of two special kinds of epilepsies, absences characterized by spike-and-wave discharges and mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. These two types correspond to different scenarios regarding the transition to epileptic seizures, namely the former is a case of a jump transition and the latter is a typical case of gradual transition. In conclusion, the necessity of developing comprehensive computational models of epileptic seizures is emphasized.},

There is a critical need for accurate prediction tools to identify patients likely to have recurrent postoperative seizures. Results from preclinical models and intracranial EEG in humans suggest that the window of time immediately before and after a seizure ("peri-ictal") represents a unique brain state with implications for clinical outcome prediction. Using a dataset of 294 patients who underwent temporal lobe resection for seizures, we show that machine learning classifiers can make accurate predictions of postoperative seizure outcome using 5 min of peri-ictal scalp EEG data that is part of universal presurgical evaluation (AUC 0.98, out-of-group testing accuracy > 90\%). This is the first approach to seizure outcome prediction that employs a routine non-invasive preoperative study (scalp EEG) with accuracy range likely to translate into a clinical tool. Decision curve analysis (DCA) shows that compared to the prevalent clinical-variable based nomogram, use of the EEG-augmented approach could decrease the rate of unsuccessful brain resections by 20\%.},

Repeated seizures will lead to the formation of an epileptogenic network that may interfere with physiological neuronal networks and thus with normal brain function: by direct activation or indirectly by deactivation during a seizure, see for example the dreamy state or the ''déja vécu'' phenomenon during temporal seizures; by ictal or post-ictal inhibition, see for example ictal or post-ictal amnesia; by a repetitive and chronic modulation leading to a reorganization of the physiological neuronal networks. The study of these interactions between epileptic and physiological neural networks must lead to better explore the patient's memory and predict memory worsening before temporal lobe surgery and to better understand the reorganization of memory networks in chronic epilepsy. The goal is double: (1) improve the prediction of post-operative memory worsening and guide rehabilitation in epileptic clinical practice; (2) improve the pathophysiological knowledge about memory processes.},

The severity of, and risks for patients associated with, seizures are largely linked to the duration of seizures. Methods that determine seizure duration based on seizure onsets could be used to help mitigate the risks associated with what might be extended seizures by guiding timely interventions. Using long-term intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings, this article presents a method for predicting whether a seizure is going to be long or short by analyzing the seizure onset. The definition of long and short depends on each patient's seizure distribution. By analyzing 2954 seizures from 10 patients, patient-specific classifiers were built to predict seizure duration given the first few seconds from the onset. The proposed methodology achieved an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) performance of 0.7 for the 5 of 10 patients with above chance prediction performance (p value from 0.04 to 10 Our results imply that the duration of seizures can be predicted from the onset in some patients.

The initial response to antiepileptic drug therapy is highly predictive of long-term outcome. Patients with intractable epilepsy may have a progressive disorder that is medically, physically, and socially disabling. Surgical resection of the epileptogenic zone or lesional pathology, or both, may significantly reduce seizure tendency in selected patients. The present review supports the position that early and effective epilepsy surgery may not only render the patient with intractable partial epilepsy seizure-free, but also allow the individual to become a participating and productive member of society. Patients with surgically remediable epileptic syndromes should be identified early in the evaluation and treatment of their seizure disorders. Favorable candidates for focal cortical resection include individuals with medial temporal lobe epilepsy and partial seizures related to selected lesional pathology, e.g. primary brain tumor or vascular anomalies. In conclusion, surgical treatment of intractable partial epilepsy has been shown to compare favorably to antiepileptic drug therapy. Individuals rendered seizure-free may experience a significant improvement in quality of life. Patients who fail to respond to initial antiepileptic drug therapy should be "triaged" to a presurgical evaluation. Ictal semiology combined with structural magnetic resonance imaging and the electroclinical correlation may permit identification of candidates for early and effective surgical treatment.},

Timely prediction with corresponding rescues and treatments can be regarded as effective countermeasure to epilepsy emergencies, while most accidental injuries can thus be avoided. Currently, how to use electroencephalogram (EEG) signals to predict seizure is becoming a highlight topic in epilepsy researches. In spite of significant progress that made, more efforts are still to be made before clinical applications. This paper reviews past epilepsy studies, including research records and critical technologies. Contributions of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) on seizure predictions have been emphasized. Since feature selection and model generalization limit prediction ratings of conventional ML measures, DL based seizure predictions predominate future epilepsy studies. Consequently, more exploration may be vitally important for promoting clinical applications of epileptic seizure prediction. 癫痫作为一种神经系统常见疾病，具有发病率高、突发性和反复性的特点。及时预测癫痫发作并进行干预治疗，可以显著减少患者的意外伤害。当前，基于脑电信号的癫痫发作预测正成为癫痫研究的热点，虽然相关研究取得很多进展，但距临床应用仍有一定距离。本文就该领域的研究进行综述，阐述了其发展历程及关键技术，着重介绍和分析基于机器学习和深度学习进行癫痫发作预测的研究进展。传统机器学习方法面临特征选取和浅层模型泛化能力弱等制约，采用深度学习进行癫痫预测逐渐成为当前发展趋势，需要开展更加深入的探索，以促进癫痫发作预测技术的临床应用。.},

Evidence suggesting that the preictal phase can sometimes be identified based on neurophysiologic signals, premonitory features, the presence of trigger factors, or self-report is also reviewed. Diary studies have shown that seizures are not randomly distributed in time and that a subgroup of persons with epilepsy can predict an impending seizure. Paper diary data and preliminary analysis of electronic diary data suggest that seizure prediction is feasible. Whereas all of this evidence sets the stage for seizure prediction and preemptive therapy, several questions remain unanswered. First, what proportion of persons with epilepsy can predict their seizures? Second, within and among individuals, how accurate is prediction? Third, can prediction be improved through education about group level or individual predictors? And finally, in a group that can make robust predictions what are the most effective interventions for reducing seizure probability at times of high risk? The answers to these questions could reduce the burden of epilepsy by making seizures predictable and setting the stage for preemptive therapy. This work could improve the understanding of epilepsy by providing a context for studying the transitions from the interictal to preictal and ictal states. More prospective studies are needed; challenges certainly exist, but as the studies discussed here demonstrate, the field is rich with promise for improving the lives of patients with epilepsy.},

  abstract = {Epilepsy is frequently associated with cognitive impairments which result from various interacting factors. The present paper deals with the contribution of neuropsychology to the characterization of the type of epilepsy and the possible mechanisms underlying idiopathic epileptic syndromes. The non-lesional, so-called idiopathic epilepsies, constitute an interesting model for assessing the relationship between epileptiform EEG discharges and cognition. Among the idiopathic generalized epilepsies, disorders of social integration and personality have been frequently reported in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME). Since similar disturbances are observed in frontal-lobe-lesioned patients, impairments in other frontal lobe functions (e.g. executive functions) might be expected in JME. This gives rise to speculation about the possible underlying pathophysiological mechanisms in JME. With regard to partial idiopathic epilepsies, benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BCECTS) may provide a useful model for the study of the relationship between epileptiform EEG discharges in the peri-sylvian region and language functions. Furthermore, the description of mild cognitive dysfunctions in BCECTS, and their persistence into adulthood, can provide information about compensatory mechanisms and may allow for the generation of remedial strategies. Thus, 'lesional' neuropsychology has given way to 'dynamic' neuropsychology based on specific postulates. By using the cognitive profile to specify the mechanism underlying the behavioral disturbances observed in different types of epilepsy, neuropsychology may eventually contribute to a revision of the present classification of epileptic syndromes. In addition, the neuropsychological data may help predict the extent and limits of functional recovery and cerebral plasticity.},

  abstract = {Focal epilepsy is a risk factor for language impairment in children. We investigated whether the current state-of-the-art deep learning network on diffusion tractography connectome can accurately predict expressive and receptive language scores of children with epilepsy. We studied 37 children with a diagnosis of drug-resistant focal epilepsy (age: 11.8 ± 3.1 years) using 3 T MRI and diffusion tractography connectome: G = (S, Ω), where S is an adjacency matrix of edges representing the connectivity strength (number of white-matter tract streamlines) between each pair of brain regions, and Ω reflects a set of brain regions. A convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained to learn the nonlinear relationship between 'S (input)' and 'language score (output)'. Repeated hold-out validation was then employed to measure the Pearson correlation and mean absolute error (MAE) between CNN-predicted and actual language scores. We found that CNN-predicted and actual scores were significantly correlated (i.e., Pearson's R/p-value: 0.82/<0.001 and 0.75/<0.001), yielding MAE: 7.77 and 7.40 for expressive and receptive scores, respectively. Specifically, sparse connectivity not only within the left cortico-cortical network but also involving the right subcortical structures was predictive of language impairment of expressive or receptive domain. Subsequent subgroup analyses inferred that the effectiveness of diffusion tractography-based prediction of language outcome was independent of clinical variables. Intrinsic diffusion tractography connectome properties may be useful for predicting the severity of baseline language dysfunction and possibly provide a better understanding of the biological mechanisms of epilepsy-related language impairment in children.},

However, in more than 30\% of cases, medication or surgery does not effectively control seizure activity. A method that predicts the onset of a seizure before it occurs may prove useful as patients might be alerted to make themselves safe or seizures could be prevented with therapeutic interventions just before they occur. Abnormal neuronal activity, the preictal state, starts a few minutes before the onset of a seizure. In recent years, different methods have been proposed to predict the start of the preictal state. These studies follow some common steps, including recording of EEG signals, preprocessing, feature extraction, classification, and postprocessing. However, online prediction of epileptic seizures remains a challenge as all these steps need further refinement to achieve high sensitivity and low false positive rate. In this paper, we present a comparison of state-of-the-art methods used to predict seizures using both scalp and intracranial EEG signals and suggest improvements to existing methods.},

Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is a multisystem genetic disorder frequently associated with early-onset, drug-resistant epilepsy, intellectual disability, and autism spectrum disorder-collectively known as TSC-associated developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE). Advances in prenatal diagnostics and biomarker research now enable presymptomatic identification of high-risk infants. This review aims to synthesize current evidence on biomarker-informed, mechanism-based strategies for secondary prevention of DEE in TSC, offering a framework for personalized early interventions. Biomarkers, such as interictal epileptiform discharges, pathogenic TSC2 variants, and advanced neuroimaging metrics, predict epilepsy risk and neurodevelopmental trajectories. Preventive approaches include early initiation of vigabatrin and mTOR inhibitors, which show potential in reducing epilepsy severity and improving outcomes. Emerging strategies, including gene therapy, multi-omic profiling, and environmental enrichment, offer promise for disease modification. By linking predictive biomarkers to disease-modifying strategies, this review outlines a proactive and personalised approach to prevent or mitigate TSC-associated DEE. These insights help advance clinical decision-making and promote a shift toward precision prevention in paediatric epilepsy.},

Endothelial-astrocyte-pericyte assemblies at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and neuroglia within the neuro-glio-vascular unit (NGVU) finely tune brain parenchymal homeostasis, safeguarding the ionic and molecular compositions of the interstitial fluid. BBB permeability with neuroinflammation and the resulting loss of brain homeostatic control are unifying mechanisms sustaining aberrant neuronal discharges, with temporal specificities linked to acute (head trauma, stroke, infections) and pre-existent (genetic) or chronic ( dysplasia, tumors, neurodegenerative disorders) pathological conditions. Within this research template, one hypothesis is that the topography of BBB damage and neuroinflammation could associate with symptoms, e.g., limbic structures for seizures or pre-frontal for psychiatric episodes. Another uncharted matter is whether seizure activity, without tissue lesions or sclerosis, is sufficient to promote stable cellular-level maladaptations in networks. Contingent to localization and duration, BBB damage and inflammation forecast pathological trajectories, and the concept of an epileptic NGVU could enable time-sensitive biomarkers to predict disease progression. The coherence between electrographic, imaging and molecular NGVU biomarkers could be established from the epileptogenic to the propagating zones. This paradigm shift could lead to new diagnostic and therapeutic modalities germane to specific epilepsies or when seizure activity represents a comorbidity.},

Previous reports suggest that in silico models cannot predict pathogenicity accurately enough for clinical use. Here we sought to establish a model to accurately predict the pathogenicity of KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 missense variants based on available in silico prediction models. ClinVar and gnomAD databases of reported KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 missense variants in patients with neonatal epilepsy were accessed and classified as benign, pathogenic, or of uncertain significance. Sensitivity, specificity, and classification accuracy for prediction of pathogenicity were determined and compared for 10 widely used prediction algorithms program. A mathematical model of the variants (KCNQ Index) was created using their amino acid location and prediction algorithm scores to improve prediction accuracy. Using clinically characterized variants, the free online tool PROVEAN accurately predicted pathogenicity 92\% of the time and the KCNQ Index had an accuracy of 96\%. However, when including the gnomAD database as benign variants, only the KCNQ Index was able to predict pathogenicity with an accuracy greater than 90\% (sensitivity = 93\% and specificity = 98\%). No model could accurately predict the phenotype of variants. We show that KCNQ channel variant pathogenicity can be predicted by a novel KCNQ Index in neonatal epilepsy. However, more work is needed to accurately predict the patient's epilepsy phenotype from in silico algorithms.},

We recruited 65 patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy who underwent preoperative neuropsychological assessment and intracranial EEG recording. The Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals evaluated the baseline and postoperative language function. During extra-operative intracranial EEG recording, we assigned patients to undergo auditory and picture naming tasks. Time-frequency analysis determined the spatiotemporal characteristics of naming-related amplitude modulations, including high gamma augmentation at 70-110 Hz. We surgically removed the presumed epileptogenic zone based on the intracranial EEG and MRI abnormalities while maximally preserving the eloquent areas defined by electrical stimulation mapping. The multivariate regression model incorporating auditory naming-related high gamma augmentation predicted the postoperative changes in Core Language Score with r2 of 0.37 and in Expressive Language Index with r2 of 0.32. Independently of the effects of epilepsy and neuroimaging profiles, higher high gamma augmentation at the resected language-dominant hemispheric area predicted a more severe postoperative decline in Core Language Score and Expressive Language Index. Conversely, the model incorporating picture naming-related high gamma augmentation predicted the change in Receptive Language Index with an r2 of 0.50. Higher high gamma augmentation independently predicted a more severe postoperative decline in Receptive Language Index. Ancillary regression analysis indicated that naming-related low gamma augmentation and alpha/beta attenuation likewise independently predicted a more severe Core Language Score decline. The machine learning-based prediction model suggested that naming-related high gamma augmentation, among all spectral responses used as predictors, most strongly contributed to the improved prediction of patients showing a >5-point Core Language Score decline (reflecting the lower 25th percentile among patients). We generated the model-based atlas visualizing sites, which, if resected, would lead to such a language decline. With a 5-fold cross-validation procedure, the auditory naming-based model predicted patients who had such a postoperative language decline with an accuracy of 0.80. The model indicated that virtual resection of an electrical stimulation mapping-defined language site would have increased the relative risk of the Core Language Score decline by 5.28 (95\% confidence interval: 3.47-8.02). Especially, that of an electrical stimulation mapping-defined receptive language site would have maximized it to 15.90 (95\% confidence interval: 9.59-26.33). In summary, naming-related spectral responses predict neuropsychological outcomes after epilepsy surgery. We have provided our prediction model as an open-source material, which will indicate the postoperative language function of future patients and facilitate external validation at tertiary epilepsy centres.},

  abstract = {Epilepsy is a recurrent chronic brain disease that affects nearly 75 million people around the world. Therefore, the ability to reliably predict epileptic seizures would be instrumental for implementing interventions to reduce brain injury and improve patients' quality of life. In addition to classical machine learning algorithms and feature engineering methods, the use of electroencephalography (EEG) to predict seizures has gradually become a mainstream trend. Here, we propose a patient-specific method to predict epileptic seizures based on EEG data acquired using spatial depth features of a three-dimensional-two-dimensional hybrid convolutional neural network (3D-2D HyCNN) model. This method facilitates the acquisition of abundant and reliable deep features from multi-channel EEG signals. We first developed a reliable data preprocessing method to reconstruct time-series EEG signals into 3D feature images. Then, the 3D-2D HyCNN model was used to extract correlation features between multiple channels of EEG signals, which are automatically exploited by the network to improve seizure prediction. The method achieved accuracy of 98.43\% and 93.11\%, sensitivity of 98.58\% and 90.98\%, and specificity of 96.86\% and 92.39\% on the CHB-MIT Scalp EEG dataset and the American Epilepsy Society Epilepsy Prediction Challenge dataset, respectively.

Infrastructure and resource requirements can further complicate case verification. Using machine-learning techniques, we have developed and tested a region-specific questionnaire panel and predictive model to identify people who have had a convulsive seizure. These findings have been implemented into a free app for health-care workers in Kenya, Uganda, Ghana, Tanzania, and South Africa. In this retrospective case-control study, we used data from the Studies of the Epidemiology of Epilepsy in Demographic Sites in Kenya, Uganda, Ghana, Tanzania, and South Africa. We randomly split these individuals using a 7:3 ratio into a training dataset and a validation dataset. We used information gain and correlation-based feature selection to identify eight binary features to predict convulsive seizures. We then assessed several machine-learning algorithms to create a multivariate prediction model. We validated the best-performing model with the internal dataset and a prospectively collected external-validation dataset. We additionally evaluated a leave-one-site-out model (LOSO), in which the model was trained on data from all sites except one that, in turn, formed the validation dataset. We used these features to develop a questionnaire-based predictive panel that we implemented into a multilingual app (the Epilepsy Diagnostic Companion) for health-care workers in each geographical region. We analysed epilepsy-specific data from 4097 people, of whom 1985 (48·5\%) had convulsive epilepsy, and 2112 were controls. From 170 clinical variables, we initially identified 20 candidate predictor features. Eight features were removed, six because of negligible information gain and two following review by a panel of qualified neurologists. Correlation-based feature selection identified eight variables that demonstrated predictive value; all were associated with an increased risk of an epileptic convulsion except one. The logistic regression, support vector, and naive Bayes models performed similarly, outperforming the decision-tree model. We chose the logistic regression model for its interpretability and implementability. The area under the receiver operator curve (AUC) was 0·92 (95\% CI 0·91-0·94, sensitivity 85·0\%, specificity 93·7\%) in the internal-validation dataset and 0·95 (0·92-0·98, sensitivity 97·5\%, specificity 82·4\%) in the external-validation dataset. Similar results were observed for the LOSO model (AUC 0·94, 0·93-0·96, sensitivity 88·2\%, specificity 95·3\%). On the basis of these findings, we developed the Epilepsy Diagnostic Companion as a predictive model and app offering a validated culture-specific and region-specific solution to confirm the diagnosis of a convulsive epileptic seizure in people with suspected epilepsy. The questionnaire panel is simple and accessible for health-care workers without specialist knowledge to administer. This tool can be iteratively updated and could lead to earlier, more accurate diagnosis of seizures and improve care for people with epilepsy.

  abstract = {Current therapies for epilepsy are largely symptomatic and do not affect the underlying mechanisms of disease progression, i.e. epileptogenesis. Given the large percentage of pharmacoresistant chronic epilepsies, novel approaches are needed to understand and modify the underlying pathogenetic mechanisms. Although different types of brain injury (e.g. status epilepticus, traumatic brain injury, stroke) can trigger epileptogenesis, astrogliosis appears to be a homotypic response and hallmark of epilepsy. Indeed, recent findings indicate that epilepsy might be a disease of astrocyte dysfunction. This review focuses on the inhibitory neuromodulator and endogenous anticonvulsant adenosine, which is largely regulated by astrocytes and its key metabolic enzyme adenosine kinase (ADK). Recent findings support the "ADK hypothesis of epileptogenesis": (i) Mouse models of epileptogenesis suggest a sequence of events leading from initial downregulation of ADK and elevation of ambient adenosine as an acute protective response, to changes in astrocytic adenosine receptor expression, to astrocyte proliferation and hypertrophy (i.e. astrogliosis), to consequential overexpression of ADK, reduced adenosine and - finally - to spontaneous focal seizure activity restricted to regions of astrogliotic overexpression of ADK. (ii) Transgenic mice overexpressing ADK display increased sensitivity to brain injury and seizures. (iii) Inhibition of ADK prevents seizures in a mouse model of pharmacoresistant epilepsy. (iv) Intrahippocampal implants of stem cells engineered to lack ADK prevent epileptogenesis. Thus, ADK emerges both as a diagnostic marker to predict, as well as a prime therapeutic target to prevent, epileptogenesis.},

Evidence that seizures can be predicted is spread over diverse sources in medical, engineering, and patent publications.

Advances in seizure prediction promise to give rise to implantable devices able to warn of impending seizures and to trigger therapy to prevent clinical epileptic attacks. Treatments such as electrical stimulation or focal drug infusion could be given on demand and might eliminate side-effects in some patients taking antiepileptic drugs long term. Whether closed-loop seizure-prediction and treatment devices will have the profound clinical effect of their cardiological predecessors will depend on our ability to perfect these techniques.

A syndromic approach to the epilepsies would be of practical value for diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic purposes. However, despite considerable efforts by leaders in the field of epileptology and the improved knowledge of the clinical, genetic, imaging, and biologic aspects of epilepsy, there are no measurable objective criteria for recognizing seizure types and epilepsy syndromes as separate diagnostic entities with well-defined prognostic and therapeutic aspects. The lack of pragmatic, evidence-based instruments to devise a syndromic classification useful for clinical practice can be explained by the evolving concept of epilepsy syndrome, its dynamic characteristics, the poor prognostic predictivity, and the extremely complex genetic and pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying the epileptic phenomena. In addition, the results of the published reports on epilepsy syndromes are mostly biased by flaws in the study population, design, and statistical analysis. The Classification Core Group of the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE), which is working on a new classification of the epilepsies, stated that the process of syndrome identification requires that an evidence-based approach be applied to the published literature and future studies.},

  abstract = {To review the therapeutic effects of deep brain stimulation of the anterior nuclei of the thalamus (ANT-DBS) and the predictors of its effectiveness, safety, and adverse effects. A comprehensive search of the medical literature (PubMed) was conducted to identify relevant articles investigating ANT-DBS therapy for epilepsy. Out of 332 references, 77 focused on focal epilepsies were reviewed. The DBS effect is probably due to decreased synchronization of epileptic activity in the cortex. The potential mechanisms from cellular to brain network levels are presented. The ANT might participate actively in the network elaborating focal seizures. The effects of ANT-DBS differed in various studies; ANT-DBS was linked with a 41\% seizure frequency reduction at 1 year, 69\% at 5 years, and 75\% at 7 years. The most frequently reported adverse effects, depression and memory impairment, were considered non-serious in the long-term follow-up view. ANT-DBS also has been used in a few cases to treat status epilepticus. We reviewed the clinical literature and identified several factors that may predict seizure outcome following DBS therapy. More large-scale trials are required since there is a need to explore stimulation settings, apply patient-tailored therapy, and identify the presurgical predictors of patient response. A critical review of the published literature on ANT-DBS in focal epilepsy is presented. ANT-DBS mechanisms are not fully understood; possible explanations are provided. Biomarkers of ANT-DBS effectiveness may lead to patient-tailored therapy.},

In the survey special emphasis is laid on the direct correlation between paroxysmal phenomena and plaques now demonstrable by modern imaging techniques. These images have shown that epileptic seizures can be caused by cortical and subcortical lesions and by their accompanying oedema. We extend the review to non-epileptic paroxysmal symptoms, such as tonic spasm, which may be confused with epileptic seizures. As far as they are supported by data, recommendations for diagnosis and therapy are given. Open questions are identified and issues for further research are suggested.},

The review examined acceptability, adherence, and ability to self-report or predict seizures, along with innovative applications of self-reported data. We comprehensively outline study characteristics, key results, and identified strengths and limitations. Sixty-eight full-text and two abstracts were included, where a total of 10 electronic tools were identified. Studies revealed high patient interest and acceptable adherence, particularly when tools were well-designed, and data shared with healthcare providers. While patients faced challenges in self-reporting or predicting seizures, a subgroup exhibited higher accuracy and compliance. Studies underscored the value of self-report information in identifying seizure clusters, understanding associations between self-reported seizure frequency and triggers, developing personalized seizure risk, forecasting and prediction models, and the potential benefits when integrated with wearable or implantable devices. Limitations included population selection, repeated dataset use, and the absence of gold standards for seizure counting. Personalizing tools to collect self-report information, integrating them with wearable technologies, utilizing collected data for clinical outcomes, and merging them with electronic health records could provide a reliable resource for epilepsy monitoring and management.},

While surgical resection has proven a viable treatment, previous studies examining postoperative seizure freedom rates are limited by small sample size and patient heterogeneity, thus exhibiting significant variability in their results. To review the medical literature on OLE so as to investigate rates and predictors of both seizure freedom and visual outcomes following surgery. We reviewed manuscripts exploring surgical resection for drug-resistant OLE published between January 1990 and June 2015 on PubMed. Seizure freedom rates were analyzed and potential predictors were evaluated with separate meta-analyses. Postoperative visual outcomes were also examined. We identified 27 case series comprising 584 patients with greater than 1 yr of follow-up. Postoperative seizure freedom (Engel class I outcome) was observed in 65\% of patients, and was significantly predicted by age less than 18 yr (odds ratio [OR] 1.54, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.13-2.18), focal lesion on pathological analysis (OR 2.08, 95\% CI 1.58-2.89), and abnormal preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (OR 3.24, 95\% 2.03-6.55). Of these patients, 175 also had visual outcomes reported with 57\% demonstrating some degree of visual decline following surgery. We did not find any relationship between postoperative visual and seizure outcomes. Surgical resection for OLE is associated with favorable outcomes with nearly two-thirds of patients achieving postoperative seizure freedom. However, patients must be counseled regarding the risk of visual decline following surgery.},

A prediction model was developed and validated enabling risk stratification which in turn informs treatment decisions and individualises counselling. Data from a randomised controlled trial was used to develop a prediction model for risk of seizure recurrence following a first seizure or diagnosis of epilepsy. Time-to-event data was modelled via Cox's proportional hazards regression. Model validity was assessed via discrimination and calibration using the original dataset and also using three external datasets - National General Practice Survey of Epilepsy (NGPSE), Western Australian first seizure database (WA) and FIRST (Italian dataset of people with first tonic-clonic seizures). People with neurological deficit, focal seizures, abnormal EEG, not indicated for CT/MRI scan, or not immediately treated have a significantly higher risk of seizure recurrence. Discrimination was fair and consistent across the datasets (c-statistics: 0.555 (NGPSE); 0.558 (WA); 0.597 (FIRST)). Calibration plots showed good agreement between observed and predicted probabilities in NGPSE at one and three years. Plots for WA and FIRST showed poorer agreement with the model underpredicting risk in WA, and over-predicting in FIRST. This was resolved following model recalibration. The model performs well in independent data especially when recalibrated. It should now be used in clinical practice as it can improve the lives of people with single seizures and early epilepsy by enabling targeted treatment choices and more informed patient counselling.},

We prospectively recruited patients with focal epilepsy who were admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for presurgical evaluation during January to December 2020. All study participants were simultaneously applied gold standard long-term video-electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring and an index test, E4. Two certified epileptologists independently determined whether captured events were seizures and then indicated ictal semiology and EEG information. Both were blind to multimodal biosignal findings detected by E4. Biosignals during 5-min epochs of both seizure events and baseline were collected and compared. Predictive models for occurrence overall and of each seizure type were developed using a generalized estimating equation. Diagnostic performance of each model was then assessed. Thirty patients had events recorded and were recruited for analysis. One hundred eight seizure events and 120 baseline epochs were collected. Heart rate (HR), acceleration (ACC), and electrodermal activity (EDA) but not temperature were significantly elevated during seizures. Cluster analysis showed trends of greatest elevation of HR and ACC in bilateral tonic-clonic seizures (BTCs), as compared with non-BTCs and isolated auras. HR and ACC were independent predictors for overall seizure types, BTCs, and non-BTCs, whereas only HR was a predictor for isolated aura. Diagnostic performance including sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the predictive model for overall seizures were 77.78\%, 60\%, and .696 (95\% confidence interval = .628-.764), respectively. Multimodal extracerebral biosignals (HR, ACC, EDA) detected by a wrist-worn smartwatch can help differentiate between epileptic seizures and normal physical activities. It would be worthwhile to implement our predictive algorithms in commercial seizure detection devices. However, larger studies to externally validate our predictive models are required.},

The purpose of this study is to improve the performance of model predicting the epilepsy surgery outcomes using genetic neural network (GNN) model based on a hybrid intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) marker. We extracted 21 SOZ related markers based on iEEG data from 79 epilepsy patients. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was employed to integrated seven markers, selected after testing in pairs with all 21 biomarkers and 7 machine learning models, into a hybrid marker. Based on the hybrid marker, we devised a GNN model and compared its predictive performance for surgical outcomes with six other mainstream machine-learning models. Compared to the mainstream models, underpinning the GNN with the hybrid iEEG marker resulted in a better prediction of surgical outcomes, showing a significant increase of the prediction accuracy from approximately 87\% to 94.3\% (P = 0.0412). This study suggests that the hybrid iEEG marker can improve the performance of model predicting the epilepsy surgical outcomes, and validates the effectiveness of the GNN in characterizing and analyzing complex relationships between clinical data variables.},

To bring personalized care to the epilepsies, there is a need for appropriate precision biomarkers that can identify disease processes or predict treatment outcomes at the individual patient level. Neuroimaging techniques, including MRI, have been transformative for clinical practice, particularly in medically refractory focal epilepsies. Advanced MRI techniques have the potential to bring precision medicine clearly into view for epileptology; however, there are challenges that must be overcome before cutting-edge neuroimaging tools can be used in clinical practice. In this review article, we communicate our view that implementation of normative modelling frameworks will help to deliver robust quantitative MRI biomarkers for individualized prediction. Here, we provide recommendations for researchers and clinicians alike, from careful research design to clinical applications, that will help to identify diagnostic and predictive imaging biomarkers. Such precision markers will be key to delivering personalized medicine for the epilepsies.},

It is mandatory to understand the epilepsy's underlying etiology, whether it is structural, genetic, infectious, metabolic, immune or (currently) unknown, as it contains major information about the clinical phenotype, cognitive comorbidities, (new) drug targets and also help to predict postsurgical outcome. A multimodal approach, including digital slides and multichannel immunofluorescence labelling can increase the diagnostic yield of subtle pathologies, while DNA methylation arrays could helps in the diagnosis of difficult-to-classify lesions. Such techniques are not always available, however, in low-income countries. Even without access to expensive molecular techniques, automated analysis scripts and machine learning algorithms can be developed by Latin American researchers to improve our diagnostic yield from routine Hematoxylin \& Eosin stained tissue sections. The pathology community of Latin America contributed substantially to our current knowledge of etiologies related to human epilepsies and experimental epilepsy models. To further boost the impact of Latin American research, local centers should adhere to modern, multimodal neuropathology techniques, integrate different levels of knowledge, and strengthen their scientific collaborations. Dedicated teaching courses in Epileptology, such as the Latin American Summer Schools of Epilepsy (LASSE) or International Summer School for Neuropathology and Epilepsy Surgery (INES) addressing young researcher and neurologists, are most successful to promote this endeavor. In this review, we will describe the state of neuropathology at the 21st century and also highlight Latin American researchers' contributions to the current knowledge in neuropathology of epilepsy.},

Our objective was to identify predictors of DRE among the four primary childhood epilepsy syndrome groups within a cohort of children with new onset seizures, using the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) definition of DRE and the recent classification of epilepsies. This is a prospective study of 676 children with new onset seizures initiated on antiseizure medication. Patients were monitored for the occurrence of DRE according to the ILAE criteria and were categorized into one of four epilepsy groups: self-limited focal epilepsies (SeLFEs), genetic generalized epilepsies (GGEs), developmental epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs), and focal epilepsies. Cox regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of DRE within each epilepsy group. Overall, 29.3\% of children were classified as having DRE, with the highest incidence observed among children diagnosed with DEEs (77.7\%), followed by focal epilepsies (31.5\%). Across the entire cohort, predictors of DRE included the presence of an epileptogenic lesion, a higher pretreatment number of seizures, experiencing multiple seizure types, presence and severity of intellectual and developmental delay, myoclonus, and younger age at epilepsy onset. Within the GGEs, only a younger age at seizure onset and experiencing multiple seizure types predicted DRE. Among focal epilepsies, predictors of DRE included the presence of an epileptogenic lesion, experiencing multiple seizure types, and having a greater number of pretreatment seizures. Within the DEEs, predictors of DRE were the occurrence of tonic seizures. Predictors of DRE within SeLFEs could not be identified. This study indicates that different epilepsy syndromes are associated with distinct predictors of drug resistance. Anticipation of drug resistance within various groups is feasible using accessible clinical variables throughout the disease course.},

Here, we delineated the genotype-phenotype spectrum of NRE, reporting an illustrative familial case and reviewing pertinent literature. Through exome sequencing (ES), we investigated a 12-year-old girl with recurrent focal motor seizures during sleep, suggestive of sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy (SHE), and a family history of epilepsy in siblings. Variant segregation analysis was performed by Sanger sequencing. All previously published NRE patients were thoroughly reviewed and their electroclinical features were analyzed and compared with the reported subjects. In the proband, ES detected the novel NPRL3 frameshift variant (NM\_001077350.3): c.151\_152del (p.Thr51Glyfs*5). This variant is predicted to cause a loss of function and segregated in one affected brother. The review of 76 patients from 18 publications revealed the predominance of focal-onset seizures (67/74-90\%), with mainly frontal and frontotemporal (32/67-47.7\%), unspecified (19/67-28\%), or temporal (9/67-13\%) onset. Epileptic syndromes included familial focal epilepsy with variable foci (FFEVF) (29/74-39\%) and SHE (11/74-14.9\%). Fifteen patients out of 60 (25\%) underwent epilepsy surgery, 11 of whom achieved complete seizure remission (11/15-73\%). Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) type 2A was the most frequent histopathological finding. We reported an illustrative NPRL3-related epilepsy (NRE) family with incomplete penetrance. This condition consists of a heterogeneous spectrum of clinical and neuroradiological features. Focal-onset motor seizures are predominant, and almost half of the cases fulfill the criteria for SHE or FFEVF. MRI-negative cases are prevalent, but the association with malformations of cortical developments (MCDs) is significant, especially FCD type 2a. The beneficial impact of epilepsy surgery in patients with MCD-related epilepsy further supports the inclusion of brain MRI in the workup of NRE patients.},

  abstract = {Planning surgery for patients with medically refractory epilepsy often requires recording seizures using intracranial EEG. Quantitative measures derived from interictal intracranial EEG yield potentially appealing biomarkers to guide these surgical procedures; however, their utility is limited by the sparsity of electrode implantation as well as the normal confounds of spatiotemporally varying neural activity and connectivity. We propose that comparing intracranial EEG recordings to a normative atlas of intracranial EEG activity and connectivity can reliably map abnormal regions, identify targets for invasive treatment and increase our understanding of human epilepsy. Merging data from the Penn Epilepsy Center and a public database from the Montreal Neurological Institute, we aggregated interictal intracranial EEG retrospectively across 166 subjects comprising >5000 channels. For each channel, we calculated the normalized spectral power and coherence in each canonical frequency band. We constructed an intracranial EEG atlas by mapping the distribution of each feature across the brain and tested the atlas against data from novel patients by generating a z-score for each channel. We demonstrate that for seizure onset zones within the mesial temporal lobe, measures of connectivity abnormality provide greater distinguishing value than univariate measures of abnormal neural activity. We also find that patients with a longer diagnosis of epilepsy have greater abnormalities in connectivity. By integrating measures of both single-channel activity and inter-regional functional connectivity, we find a better accuracy in predicting the seizure onset zones versus normal brain (area under the curve = 0.77) compared with either group of features alone. We propose that aggregating normative intracranial EEG data across epilepsy centres into a normative atlas provides a rigorous, quantitative method to map epileptic networks and guide invasive therapy. We publicly share our data, infrastructure and methods, and propose an international framework for leveraging big data in surgical planning for refractory epilepsy.},

Concordance with ClinC was seen in 80 patients (76\%) for ISSPECT, in 46 patients (79\%) for PET, and in 37 patients (64\%) for ISSPECT + PET. Fifty-six patients (53\%) were planned for intracranial video-electroencephalography monitoring (IVEM). Those with ClinC-PET concordance were likely to proceed to IVEM (p = 0.02). ClinC-PET concordance and ClinC-ISSPECT concordance did not predict decision to proceed to surgery, but VEM-MRI concordance did in lesional cases (p = 0.018). Forty-five (42\%) underwent surgery of which 29 had minimum follow-up for 1 year (mean, 20 months; SD, 8) and 22 (76\%) had Engel class I outcomes.

  abstract = {After medial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) surgery, there is considerable individual variation in the extent, nature and direction of postoperative memory change. Before surgery, epileptic patients who are surgery candidates need precise information about the potential cognitive after effects, and particularly in temporal lobe epilepsy, postoperative memory changes. Clinical and neuropsychological data may bring useful information to predict the postoperative memory outcome, but, these data are not always sufficient to replace the Wada test, considered for a long time, as the gold standard to predict postoperative decline following surgery. In any case, numerous studies demonstrate that the Wada procedure can be nowadays reliably replaced by functional MRI (fMRI) activation studies. A vast majority of fMRI studies suggest that it is the functional adequacy of the resected hippocampus rather than the functional reserve of the contralateral hippocampus that determines the extent of postoperative memory decline. In addition, new functional neuroimaging procedures that explore more widespread network disruptions commonly found in MTLE such as diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) or connectivity studies could in the future constitute a reliable approach combined with fMRI activation studies to significantly improve the prediction of postsurgical memory decline.},

In pediatric epilepsy, seizure pathology has not always yielded the expected material-specific memory profiles. This study used the Wide Range Assessment of Memory and Learning-Second Edition (WRAML-2) to assess memory functioning among pediatric patients with epilepsy. The WRAML-2 was administered to 180 youth with epilepsy during their neuropsychological evaluations. Memory and recognition scores correlated significantly with epilepsy severity variables. There were no significant differences in verbal and visual memory and recognition index scores among patients with generalized epilepsy or among those with lateralized or localized electroencephalography (EEG) patterns and lesions on imaging. However, clinically meaningful verbal versus visual discrepancy scores were significantly related to lateralized abnormalities on EEG and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results. Most patients with right hemisphere pathology showed the expected material-specific visual memory deficits, while fewer than 15\% of the left hemisphere cases showed the expected verbal memory deficits. Over one-third of those with identified left-sided pathology showed clinically significant deficits in visual memory. Findings are incongruent with the material-specific memory model and reflect the fact that early developmental neurological insults can lead to functional reorganization/crowding effects in children with left hemisphere epilepsy. On exploratory analyses, there were no significant differences in discrepancy scores among participants with left, right, and bilateral languages on Wada and functional MRI (fMRI). However, those with right and bilateral language dominance were more likely to show discrepancies that were incongruent with the material-specific model.},

The aim of the present study was to investigate the clinical course and outcome of idiopathic childhood epilepsy and identify variables determining both early and long-term prognosis. We followed 303 children with newly diagnosed idiopathic epilepsy aged 1-14 years old, both prospectively and retrospectively. Outcome was defined at one, 2 and 4 years of follow-up, as well as at the end of the study period for all patients. Based on the data collected, patients were classified in four patterns of clinical course: "excellent", "improving", "relapsing" and "poor". Variables defined at intake and after the initial year of treatment were analyzed for their prognostic relevance towards the clinical course and outcome of the patients. The mean age at seizure onset was 6.7 years and the mean duration of follow-up was 8.3 years (range 2,0-22,0,SD 4,24). During the initial year of treatment, 70,3\% of patients were seizure-free. The course of epilepsy was "excellent" in 53,1\% of the subjects, "improving" in 22,8\%, "relapsing" in 22,1\% whereas only 6 children with idiopathic epilepsy (2\%) had a "poor" clinical course exhibiting drug-resistance. After multivariate analysis, variables predictive of a poor initial response to therapy were early seizure onset, multiple seizure types and history of status epilepticus. At the end of follow-up, early response to treatment was of significant positive predictive value, while the presence of multiple seizure types and the history of migraine had a negative impact on prognosis. In the vast majority of children, the long-term prognosis of idiopathic epilepsy is favorable. More than half of the patients attain seizure freedom immediately and their clinical course is considered "excellent". About one fifth exhibit either an improving or a fluctuating course. Early seizure onset, multiple seizure types and status epilepticus are predictive of an initial poor response to treatment in children with idiopathic epilepsy. Initial non-response to treatment, multiple seizure types and history of migraine are determinants of a less favorable final outcome after long-term follow-up.},

We explored whether replacing the severity of stroke at admission with the severity of stroke after treatment at 72 h from onset could improve the predictive accuracy of the score. We retrospectively identified consecutive adults with acute first-ever neuroimaging-confirmed ischemic stroke who were admitted to the Stroke Unit of the Ospedale Civile Baggiovara (Modena, Italy) and treated with intravenous thrombolysis and/or endovascular treatment. Study outcome was the occurrence of at least one unprovoked seizure presenting >7 days after stroke. Participants included in the analysis numbered 1094. The median age of the subjects was 74 (interquartile range [IQR] = 64-81) years, and 595 (54.4\%) were males. Sixty-five (5.9\%) subjects developed unprovoked seizures a median of 10 (IQR = 6-27) months after stroke. The median values of the original and modified SeLECT2.0 scores were 3 (IQR = 2-4) and 2 (IQR = 1-3). The modified SeLECT 2.0 score showed better discrimination for the prediction of poststroke epilepsy at 36, 48, and 60 months after stroke compared to the original score according to the area under time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curves. The modified SeLECT 2.0 score had higher values of Harrell C and Somers D parameters and lower values of Akaike and Bayesian information criteria than the original score. The modified SeLECT 2.0 score produced more accurate risk predictions compared to the SeLECT 2.0 score at all evaluated time points from 12 to 60 months after stroke according to the Net Reclassification Index. Replacing baseline with posttreatment stroke severity may improve the ability of the SeLECT 2.0 score to predict poststroke epilepsy.},

We evaluated the neuropsychological functions in children suffering from three main epilepsy categories. Further, we analyzed the longitudinal evolution of the neuropsychological profile over time. Patients undergoing neuropsychological evaluation at our Department from 2012 to 2018 were identified retrospectively. We selected patients aged 6-16 years and with at least two evaluations. Three epilepsy categories were considered: focal/structural, focal self-limited, and idiopathic generalized. Each evaluation included the same structured assessment of main neuropsychological domains. The effect of the epilepsy category, illness duration, seizure status, and medication was computed in multilevel models. We identified 103 patients (focal self-limited = 27; focal/structural = 51; and idiopathic generalized = 25), for 233 evaluations. The majority of deficits were reported in attention and executive functions (>30\% of patients); the results were dichotomized to obtain global indexes. Multilevel models showed a trend toward statistical significance of category of epilepsy on the global executive index and of illness duration on global attention index. Illness duration predicted the scores of executive and attention tasks, while category and medication predicted executive task performance. Focal/structural epilepsies mostly affected the executive domain, with deficits persisting over time. By contrast, an ameliorative effect of illness duration for attention was documented in all epilepsies. This study offers lacking information about the evolution of deficits in time, the role of epilepsy category, and possible psychological implications for high-order cognitive skills, central in several social and academic problems.},

In this intracranial EEG-fMRI study, we evaluated the utility of these methods to localize clinically relevant regions preoperatively and compared the extent of resection of these areas to postoperative outcome. Seventy patients admitted for intracranial video-EEG monitoring were recruited for a simultaneous intracranial EEG-fMRI study. For all analyses of blood oxygen level-dependent responses associated with IEDs, an experienced epileptologist identified the most clinically relevant brain activation cluster using available clinical information. The maximum cluster (the cluster with the highest z-score) was also identified for all analyses and assigned to one of three confidence levels (low, medium or high) based on the difference of the peak z-scores between the maximum and second maximum cluster (the cluster with the second highest peak z-value). The distance was measured and compared between the peak voxel of the aforementioned clusters and the electrode contacts where the interictal discharge and seizure onset were recorded. In patients who subsequently underwent epilepsy surgery, the spatial concordance between the aforementioned clusters and the area of resection was determined and compared to postoperative outcome. We evaluated 106 different IEDs in 70 patients. Both subjective (identification of the clinically relevant cluster) and objective (maximum cluster much more significant than the second maximum cluster) methods of culling non-localizing EEG-fMRI activation maps increased the spatial concordance between these clusters and the corresponding IED or seizure onset zone contacts. However, only the objective methods of identifying medium and high confidence maps resulted in a significant association between resection of the peak voxel of the maximum cluster and postoperative outcome. Resection of this area was associated with good postoperative outcomes but was not sufficient for seizure freedom. On the other hand, we found that failure to resect the medium and high confidence maximum clusters was associated with a poor post-surgical outcome (negative predictive value = 1.0, sensitivity = 1.0). Methods to identify higher confidence EEG-fMRI results are needed to localize areas necessary for good postoperative outcomes. However, resection of the peak voxel within higher confidence maximum clusters is not sufficient for good outcomes. Conversely, failure to resect the peak voxel in these clusters is associated with a poor post-surgical outcome.},

  abstract = {A big advance in epileptology has been the recognition of syndromes with distinct aetiology, clinical and EEG features, treatment and prognosis. A prime and common example of this is rolandic epilepsy that is well known by the general paediatricians for over 50 years, thus allowing a precise diagnosis that predicts an excellent prognosis. However, rolandic is not the only benign childhood epileptic syndrome. Converging evidence from multiple and independent clinical, EEG and magnetoencephalographic studies has documented Panayiotopoulos syndrome (PS) as a model of childhood autonomic epilepsy, which is also common and benign. Despite high prevalence, lengthy and dramatic features, PS as well as autonomic status epilepticus had eluded recognition because emetic and other ictal autonomic manifestations were dismissed as non-epileptic events of other diseases. Furthermore, PS because of frequent EEG occipital spikes has been erroneously considered as occipital epilepsy and thus confused with the idiopathic childhood occipital epilepsy of Gastaut (ICOE-G), which is another age-related but rarer and of unpredictable prognosis syndrome. Encephalitis is a common misdiagnosis for PS and migraine with visual aura for ICOE-G. Pathophysiologically, the symptomatogenic zone appears to correspond to the epileptogenic zone in rolandic epilepsy (sensory-motor symptomatology of the rolandic cortex) and the ICOE-G (occipital lobe symptomatology), while the autonomic clinical manifestations of PS are likely to be generated by variable and widely spread epileptogenic foci acting upon a temporarily hyperexcitable central autonomic network. Rolandic epilepsy, PS, ICOE-G and other possible clinical phenotypes of benign childhood focal seizures are likely to be linked together by a genetically determined, functional derangement of the systemic brain maturation that is age related (benign childhood seizure susceptibility syndrome). This is usually mild but exceptionally it may diverge to serious epileptic disorders such as epileptic encephalopathy with continuous spike and wave during sleep. Links with other benign and age-related seizures in early life such as febrile seizures, benign focal neonatal and infantile seizures is possible. Overlap with idiopathic generalized epilepsies is limited and of uncertain genetic significance. Taking all these into account, benign childhood focal seizures and related epileptic syndromes would need proper multi-disciplinary re-assessment in an evidence-based manner.},

The PPK parameter values of group A were calculated to establish a PPK Model by using the NPEM Program of USC*PACK software. Based on it, VPA serum concentrations of group B were predicted with the Bayesian Fitting Program of the USC*PACK software. To assess the accuracy and precision of prediction, a paired-comparisons t-test was run between predicted and observed concentrations, and then the mean prediction error (MPE), mean square prediction error (MSPE), root mean square prediction error (RMSPE), and coincidence rates for different percentages of prediction error were all calculated. Optimum PPK parameters were: Ka, 2.522+/-2.743 h(-1); Vs, 0.329+/-0.496 L/kg; and Kel, 0.0438+/-0.0384 h(-1). For group B, there was no significant difference between predicted and observed concentrations. MPE was -0.43 mg/L, MSPE was 115.40 (mg/L)2, and RMSPE was 5.47 mg/L. The coincidence rates for percentages of prediction error, which were less than 5 \%, 10 \%, 15 \%, 20 \%, 25 \%, and 30 \%, were 62 \%, 74 \%, 82 \%, 85 \%, 89 \%, and 93 \%, respectively.

Herein, we developed an AED response scale based on clinical factors and video-electroencephalography (VEEG) in MRI-negative patients with epilepsy.

The clinical and VEEG factors were evaluated in univariate analyses and multivariate logistic regression analyses. A scale was derived and the scores categorized into 3 risk levels of DRE-MRI (-). A scale was established based on 4 independent risk factors for DRE-MRI (-). The scale had a sensitivity of 83.87\%, specificity of 80.20\%, positive likelihood ratio of 4.24, negative likelihood ratio of 0.20, and showed good discrimination with the area under the curve (AUC) of 0.886 (0.826-0.946). The categorization of the risk score based on this scale was: low risk (0-3 points), medium risk (3-5 points), and high risk (>5 points). We established a DRE-MRI (-) scale with a good sensitivity and specificity, which may be useful for clinicians when making medical decisions in patients with MRI-negative epilepsy.},

Rare non-coding variants have been largely ignored in studies on epilepsy, although non-coding single nucleotide variants can have a significant impact on gene expression. We had access to whole genome sequencing (WGS) from 247 epilepsy patients and 377 controls. To assess the functional impact of non-coding variants, ExPecto, a deep learning algorithm was used to predict expression change in brain tissues. We compared the burden of rare non-coding deleterious variants between cases and controls. Rare non-coding highly deleterious variants were significantly enriched in Genetic Generalized Epilepsy (GGE), but not in Non-Acquired Focal Epilepsy (NAFE) or all epilepsy cases when compared with controls. In this study we showed that rare non-coding deleterious variants are associated with epilepsy, specifically with GGE. Larger WGS epilepsy cohort will be needed to investigate those effects at a greater resolution. Nevertheless, we demonstrated the importance of studying non-coding regions in epilepsy, a disease where new discoveries are scarce.},
