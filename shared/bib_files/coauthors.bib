  abstract = {Accurate seizure prediction will transform epilepsy management by offering warnings to patients or triggering interventions. However, state-of-the-art algorithm design relies on accessing adequate long-term data. Crowd-sourcing ecosystems leverage quality data to enable cost-effective, rapid development of predictive algorithms. A crowd-sourcing ecosystem for seizure prediction is presented involving an international competition, a follow-up held-out data evaluation, and an online platform, Epilepsyecosystem.org, for yielding further improvements in prediction performance. Crowd-sourced algorithms were obtained via the 'Melbourne-University AES-MathWorks-NIH Seizure Prediction Challenge' conducted at kaggle.com. Long-term continuous intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) data (442 days of recordings and 211 lead seizures per patient) from prediction-resistant patients who had the lowest seizure prediction performances from the NeuroVista Seizure Advisory System clinical trial were analysed. Contestants (646 individuals in 478 teams) from around the world developed algorithms to distinguish between 10-min inter-seizure versus pre-seizure data clips. Over 10 000 algorithms were submitted. The top algorithms as determined by using the contest data were evaluated on a much larger held-out dataset. The data and top algorithms are available online for further investigation and development. The top performing contest entry scored 0.81 area under the classification curve. The performance reduced by only 6.7% on held-out data. Many other teams also showed high prediction reproducibility. Pseudo-prospective evaluation demonstrated that many algorithms, when used alone or weighted by circadian information, performed better than the benchmarks, including an average increase in sensitivity of 1.9 times the original clinical trial sensitivity for matched time in warning. These results indicate that clinically-relevant seizure prediction is possible in a wider range of patients than previously thought possible. Moreover, different algorithms performed best for different patients, supporting the use of patient-specific algorithms and long-term monitoring. The crowd-sourcing ecosystem for seizure prediction will enable further worldwide community study of the data to yield greater improvements in prediction performance by way of competition, collaboration and synergism.10.1093/brain/awy210_video1awy210media15817489051001.},

abstract = {Background
Seizure prediction can increase independence and allow preventative treatment for patients with epilepsy. We present a proof-of-concept for a seizure prediction system that is accurate, fully automated, patient-specific, and tunable to an individual's needs.
Methods
Intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) data of ten patients obtained from a seizure advisory system were analyzed as part of a pseudoprospective seizure prediction study. First, a deep learning classifier was trained to distinguish between preictal and interictal signals. Second, classifier performance was tested on held-out iEEG data from all patients and benchmarked against the performance of a random predictor. Third, the prediction system was tuned so sensitivity or time in warning could be prioritized by the patient. Finally, a demonstration of the feasibility of deployment of the prediction system onto an ultra-low power neuromorphic chip for autonomous operation on a wearable device is provided.
Results
The prediction system achieved mean sensitivity of 69% and mean time in warning of 27%, significantly surpassing an equivalent random predictor for all patients by 42%.
Conclusion
This study demonstrates that deep learning in combination with neuromorphic hardware can provide the basis for a wearable, real-time, always-on, patient-specific seizure warning system with low power consumption and reliable long-term performance.}

  abstract = {We report on a quantitative analysis of electrocorticography data from a study that acquired continuous ambulatory recordings in humans over extended periods of time. The objectives were to examine patterns of seizures and spontaneous interictal spikes, their relationship to each other, and the nature of periodic variation. The recorded data were originally acquired for the purpose of seizure prediction, and were subsequently analysed in further detail. A detection algorithm identified potential seizure activity and a template matched filter was used to locate spikes. Seizure events were confirmed manually and classified as either clinically correlated, electroencephalographically identical but not clinically correlated, or subclinical. We found that spike rate was significantly altered prior to seizure in 9 out of 15 subjects. Increased pre-ictal spike rate was linked to improved predictability; however, spike rate was also shown to decrease before seizure (in 6 out of the 9 subjects). The probability distribution of spikes and seizures were notably similar, i.e. at times of high seizure likelihood the probability of epileptic spiking also increased. Both spikes and seizures showed clear evidence of circadian regulation and, for some subjects, there were also longer term patterns visible over weeks to months. Patterns of spike and seizure occurrence were highly subject-specific. The pre-ictal decrease in spike rate is not consistent with spikes promoting seizures. However, the fact that spikes and seizures demonstrate similar probability distributions suggests they are not wholly independent processes. It is possible spikes actively inhibit seizures, or that a decreased spike rate is a secondary symptom of the brain approaching seizure. If spike rate is modulated by common regulatory factors as seizures then spikes may be useful biomarkers of cortical excitability.},

For that purpose, a feature of iEEG to characterize the ictal state with high specificity and sensitivity is necessary. We evaluated the use of phase–amplitude coupling (PAC) of iEEG signals over a period of 24 h to detect the ictal and interictal states. PAC was estimated by using a synchronisation index (SI) for iEEG signals from seven patients with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy. iEEG signals of the ictal state was characterised by a strong PAC between the phase of β and the amplitude of high γ. Furthermore, using SI values, the ictal state was successfully detected with significantly higher accuracy than by using the amplitude of high γ alone. In conclusion, PAC accurately distinguished the ictal state from the interictal state.</jats:p>},

  abstract = {<jats:p>High-γ amplitude (80–150 Hz) represents motor information, such as movement types, on the sensorimotor cortex. In several cortical areas, high-γ amplitudes are coupled with low-frequency phases, e.g., α and θ (phase–amplitude coupling, PAC). However, such coupling has not been studied in the sensorimotor cortex; thus, its potential functional role has yet to be explored. We investigated PAC of high-γ amplitude in the sensorimotor cortex during waiting for and the execution of movements using electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings in humans. ECoG signals were recorded from the sensorimotor cortices of 4 epilepsy patients while they performed three different hand movements. A subset of electrodes showed high-γ activity selective to movement type around the timing of motor execution, while the same electrodes showed nonselective high-γ activity during the waiting period (&gt;2 s before execution). Cross frequency coupling analysis revealed that the high-γ amplitude during waiting was strongly coupled with the α phase (10–14 Hz) at the electrodes with movement-selective high-γ amplitudes during execution. This coupling constituted the high-γ amplitude peaking around the trough of the α oscillation, and its strength and phase were not predictive of movement type. As the coupling attenuated toward the timing of motor execution, the high-γ amplitude appeared to be released from the α phase to build a motor representation with phase-independent activity. Our results suggest that PAC modulates motor representation in the sensorimotor cortex by holding and releasing high-γ activity in movement-selective cortical regions.</jats:p>},
