# ROLE: engine-vendored — DO NOT edit here. `scitex-writer update-project`
# overwrites this file on every re-vendor; fix it upstream in the
# scitex-writer package instead (local edits are lost, and update-project
# may set it read-only in the consumer workspace after vendoring).
# File: scripts/python/check_citation_trust.py
# Purpose: CITATION-TRUSTWORTHINESS check -- beyond "does the \cite key exist in
#          the .bib" (check_ref_integrity) and beyond "is the entry a scholar
#          stub" (check_citations): actually RESOLVE every cited entry against
#          the real bibliographic record (CrossRef / OpenAlex / arXiv / Semantic
#          Scholar) and flag the ones that cannot be shown to be a real,
#          trustworthy source.
#
#          Verification is DELEGATED to scitex-scholar (>= 1.2.1, the `scholar`
#          extra): `from scitex_scholar.verify_cites import verify_cites`.
#          "Trustworthy" in scholar's terms = the entry resolves to a real
#          source AND its claimed title fuzzy-matches what that source says
#          (>= min_confidence).
#          KNOWN GAP (not covered): scholar does NOT check retraction status or
#          predatory venues -- a resolvable, title-matching citation to a
#          RETRACTED paper still classifies as `verified` here.
#
#          Status -> severity mapping (agreed on card
#          writer-dynamic-paper-findings-feed):
#            verified                     -> info (suppressed; counted as pass)
#            unverified / stub / unlinked -> warning
#            hallucinated                 -> error
#          A finding's severity is then CLAMPED by the resolved level: at
#          level=warn an error-mapped finding is still reported LOUDLY but does
#          not block (exit 0); at level=error it blocks (exit 1).
#
#          FAIL-LOUD, NEVER SILENTLY PASS. When verification is UN-RUNNABLE
#          (scitex-scholar not installed, bib unresolvable, network down,
#          resolver crash), the check reports the un-runnable condition at the
#          resolved level -- WARN by default, FAIL at level=error -- and emits
#          NO pass. No code path reports a citation as trustworthy without an
#          actual verdict for it.
#
#          CACHING is mandatory (scholar has none in this path); see
#          _citation_trust_cache.py. Verdicts are keyed by cite key + bib-entry
#          content hash in .scitex/writer/runtime/citation_trust.json; a cache
#          miss forces real verification; OFFLINE verdicts are never cached.
#
#          DEFAULT = warn: a network-dependent check must never block a compile
#          by default. Set citation_trust.level: error to gate.
#
#          Severity precedence: --level > env SCITEX_WRITER_CITATION_TRUST >
#          project ./config.yaml citation_trust.level > user
#          ~/.scitex/writer/config.yaml citation_trust.level > warn.
#
# Usage:
#   python check_citation_trust.py [project_dir] [--level off|warn|error]
#                                  [--bib PATH] [--offline]
#                                  [--min-confidence 0.8] [--no-cache]
#
# Self-contained: stdlib + optional PyYAML (config) + optional scitex-scholar
# (the verifier itself; its absence is reported LOUDLY, never as a pass).
