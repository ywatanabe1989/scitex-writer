# ROLE: engine-vendored — DO NOT edit here. `scitex-writer update-project`
# overwrites this file on every re-vendor; fix it upstream in the
# scitex-writer package instead (local edits are lost, and update-project
# may set it read-only in the consumer workspace after vendoring).
# File: scripts/python/manuscript_hints.py
# Purpose: Emit a structured MANUSCRIPT-HINTS feed (JSON) that the writer UI's
#          Details pane renders as non-intrusive, Overleaf/OpenAI-style inline
#          HINTS about the manuscript — the DATA layer of the dynamic-paper
#          experience ("a research agent that reacts to your work").
#
#          The compile pipeline already COMPUTES some of these signals (undefined
#          \ref cross-references in the LaTeX log). This turns them into ONE
#          machine-readable feed a UI (or an agent) can SUBSCRIBE to and surface
#          inline + quietly, instead of only fail-loud stderr / build gates.
#
#          NEUTRAL, MULTI-PRODUCER: writer owns the SCHEMA + the UI; each PRODUCER
#          (this writer/latex-structure producer, scitex-clew for provenance +
#          citations, a third party) writes hints into the feed under its own
#          `source`. Writer does not import clew. (Retiring the interim \cite +
#          claim readers here once clew ships its export_manuscript_hints
#          producer — see the card; \ref stays writer's, it is latex structure,
#          not provenance.)
#
#          IMMUTABLE ORIGINAL: never edits the manuscript or the PDF; reads
#          compile artifacts, writes a sidecar. ADVISORY: always exits 0 — a
#          hints feed must never break a compile.
#
#          Feed schema (manuscript-hints/1) -- one flat list, additive:
