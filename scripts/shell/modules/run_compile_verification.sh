# POST-compile verification gate. Runs scripts/python/check_compile_artifacts.py
# at its RESOLVED severity (off|warn|error via CLI/env/config). It catches a
# FALSE-SUCCESS compile (exit 0 but DEFICIENT PDF): the compiled .tex emits N
# \includegraphics but the PDF embeds 0 images (silent figure miss -- the
# 2026-06-30 incident), plus secondary log deficiency signals.
#   off   -> no-op (exit 0)
#   warn  -> reports, exit 0 (does NOT block)
#   error -> exit 1 (blocks, fail-loud) when the PDF is deficient
# Default error. The PDF embedding check needs poppler (pdfimages); when absent
# it warns and does not block (the compile host has poppler).
