\item Phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) dynamics analyzed in long-term iEEG data from 9 epilepsy patients (6 months to >1 year continuous recording)

\item Optimized PAC computation pipeline processes >30,000 seizure segments using PyTorch acceleration and SQLite3 database management

\item Distinct PAC signatures identified in pre-ictal, ictal, and post-ictal periods, particularly in theta/alpha-gamma coupling

\item PAC-based features demonstrate high discrimination between interictal and pre-ictal states for seizure prediction

\item Continuous PAC monitoring shows promise for improving implantable seizure advisory systems
