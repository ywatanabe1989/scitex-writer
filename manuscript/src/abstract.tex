Neural oscillations exhibit complex cross-frequency interactions that are fundamental to brain function and disrupted in neurological disorders. Phase-amplitude coupling (PAC), where the phase of low-frequency oscillations modulates the amplitude of high-frequency activity, serves as a biomarker for various brain states including epileptic seizures. Previous studies have demonstrated PAC changes around seizure events, but comprehensive characterization across extended timescales remains limited due to the scarcity of long-term recording data and computational constraints. The challenge of processing continuous, long-term neural recordings has hindered the development of reliable seizure prediction systems. Here we show that GPU-accelerated PAC computation enables comprehensive analysis of 4.1 TB of continuous intracranial electroencephalogram data from 15 patients with focal epilepsy (NeuroVista dataset), encompassing 1,539 seizures over monitoring periods ranging from 6 months to 2 years. \hl{We found distinct PAC signatures between theta-to-beta phase (2-30 Hz, 25 bands) and gamma amplitude (60-180 Hz, 25 bands) that systematically modulated 5-60 minutes before seizure onset}, achieving balanced accuracy of \hl{0.55±0.04} and ROC-AUC of \hl{0.58±0.02} for discriminating pre-ictal from interictal states. Our GPU-accelerated implementation achieved \hl{100-fold} speed improvements compared to conventional CPU-based methods, reducing computation time from years to months and potentially enabling real-time PAC monitoring with less than 2-minute processing latency. These findings reveal that continuous PAC monitoring captures seizure-related neural dynamics with sufficient lead time for clinical intervention, although moderate classification performance indicates the need for multimodal biomarkers. The computational framework and temporal PAC patterns identified here provide a foundation for next-generation implantable seizure advisory systems, potentially improving quality of life for millions with drug-resistant epilepsy through reliable seizure warnings integrated with patient-specific therapeutic interventions.
