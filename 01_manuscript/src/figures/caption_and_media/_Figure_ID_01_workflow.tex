SciTex manuscript compilation workflow

The diagram shows the manuscript preparation process from content input to final document generation. The image processing pipeline handles multiple input formats: Mermaid diagrams (.mmd), PowerPoint presentations (.pptx), and standard image files. Each format undergoes specific conversions including: 1) Mermaid to PNG conversion, 2) PNG to TIF conversion, 3) PPTX to TIF conversion, 4) automatic image cropping to remove excess whitespace, 5) image optimization for quality and file size, and 6) standardization to JPG format for final document inclusion. The system maintains consistent figure quality through defined processing steps integrated with the main document compilation.
