Neural oscillations exhibit cross-frequency interactions that are fundamental to brain function and disrupted in neurological disorders. Phase-amplitude coupling (PAC), where the phase of low-frequency oscillations modulates the amplitude of high-frequency activity, serves as a biomarker for various brain states including epileptic seizures. Previous studies have demonstrated PAC changes around seizure events, but characterization across extended timescales remains limited availability of long-term recording data and high computational requirements in PAC computation. The challenge of processing continuous, long-term neural recordings has hindered the development of reliable seizure prediction systems. Here we show that the combination of the NeuroVista dataset and our GPU-accelerated PAC computation system enables ...

comprehensive analysis of 4.1 TB of continuous intracranial electroencephalogram data from 15 patients with focal epilepsy (NeuroVista dataset), encompassing 1,539 seizures over monitoring periods ranging from 6 months to 2 years. \hl{We found distinct PAC signatures between theta-to-beta phase (2-30 Hz, 25 bands) and gamma amplitude (60-180 Hz, 25 bands) that systematically modulated 5-60 minutes before seizure onset}, achieving balanced accuracy of \hl{0.55±0.04} and ROC-AUC of \hl{0.58±0.02} for discriminating pre-ictal from interictal states. Our GPU-accelerated implementation achieved \hl{100-fold} speed improvements compared to conventional CPU-based methods, reducing computation time from years to months and potentially enabling real-time PAC monitoring with less than 2-minute processing latency. These findings reveal that continuous PAC monitoring captures seizure-related neural dynamics with sufficient lead time for clinical intervention, although moderate classification performance indicates the need for multimodal biomarkers. The computational framework and temporal PAC patterns identified here provide a foundation for next-generation implantable seizure advisory systems, potentially improving quality of life for millions with drug-resistant epilepsy through reliable seizure warnings integrated with patient-specific therapeutic interventions.

\section{Introduction}

Epilepsy affects approximately 70 million people worldwide, representing one of the most prevalent neurological disorders characterized by recurrent, unpredictable seizures that fundamentally disrupt daily life and impose substantial societal burden \hlref{WHO2023}. Drug-resistant focal epilepsy, occurring in approximately 30-40\% of epilepsy patients, remains particularly challenging as conventional antiepileptic medications fail to provide adequate seizure control despite optimal medical management \hlref{Kwan2000,Chen2018}. The development of reliable seizure prediction systems represents a critical frontier in epilepsy care, offering the potential to transform patient management from reactive treatment to proactive intervention, thereby reducing seizure-related injuries, psychological burden, and improving quality of life for millions of individuals with drug-resistant epilepsy \hlref{Mormann2007,Kuhlmann2018}.

Existing seizure prediction approaches face several critical limitations that have hindered clinical translation. Current machine learning methods achieve [ACCURACY RANGE]\% accuracy across studies, yet clinically successful prediction algorithms remain unavailable due to [SPECIFIC LIMITATIONS: overfitting, limited datasets, computational constraints]. Deep learning approaches, while showing promise in controlled settings, suffer from overfitting with limited patient samples and require extensive hyperparameter optimization that reduces generalizability across diverse epilepsy phenotypes \hlref{RecentMLReviews}. Most published studies analyze [TYPICAL DATASET SIZE] seizures per patient over [TYPICAL DURATION] monitoring periods, insufficient for establishing robust predictive models \hlref{LimitationsStudies}. These limitations underscore the critical need for computationally efficient, interpretable biomarkers requiring minimal hyperparameter tuning.

Phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) represents a promising biomarker for seizure prediction, quantifying the modulation of high-frequency amplitude by low-frequency phase oscillations that reflects fundamental neural communication mechanisms \hlref{Tort2010}. Previous electrophysiological studies demonstrated PAC alterations [TIME RANGE] before seizure onset in [NUMBER] patients, achieving [SENSITIVITY VALUES]\% sensitivity and [SPECIFICITY VALUES]\% specificity \hlref{PreviousPACStudies}. However, comprehensive PAC analysis has been limited by computational bottlenecks - conventional CPU implementations require [PROCESSING TIME] per [DATA DURATION], making real-time applications impractical \hlref{ComputationalLimitations}. Long-term stability of PAC features over months-to-years monitoring periods remains unclear, limiting clinical applicability.

In this study, we hypothesized that i) PAC computation is accerelated using GPU parallelization and applicable to real-time prediction, ii) PAC features can be reliable biomarkers for seizure prediction. To address these hypotheses, we developed a GPU-accelerated PAC computation framework and applied to one-of-a-kind long-term recording the NeuroVista dataset, and performed exploratory data analyses, seizure type classification tasks, and peseudo-prospective seizure prediction tasks.

These findings establish PAC as a computationally tractable biomarker for seizure prediction in large-scale clinical datasets, providing a foundation for next-generation implantable advisory systems that could transform epilepsy management from reactive to predictive care and implications for underlying mechanisms of seizure occurrence.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Ethics}
The NeuroVista dataset was previously collected through approved clinical trials with full informed consent from all participants. All data collection and analyses were conducted under ethical approval from the ethical committees of \hl{XXX}. 

\subsection{Dataset and Study Design}
The NeuroVista dataset, detailed in Cook et al. (2013) \hlref{Cook2013}, comprises continuous intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) recordings from 15 subjects with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. Data were collected via clinical trial through the International Epilepsy Electrophysiology Portal (ieeg.org) with subjects implanted with 16-channel platinum-iridium electrode arrays positioned around the clinically-identified seizure onset zone. Signals were sampled at 400 Hz and wirelessly transmitted to external personal advisory devices.

The dataset encompasses 4.1 TB of continuous recordings with individual monitoring periods ranging from 6 months to over 2 years. From the complete dataset containing multiple seizure types, this study analyzed 1,539 Type 1 (clinical) seizures with verified clinical manifestations across all 15 patients to ensure clinical relevance and interpretability of prediction algorithms.

\subsection{Definitions of Relative Temporal Windows from Seizure Onset}
For each seizure event, relative to seizure onset ($t = 0$) spanning from -1440 minutes (24 hours) to +10 minutes were defined using the following sampling strategy to increase coverage of time windows while controlling computational applicability. Specifically, timestamps were generated using a hybrid sampling approach combining logarithmic and linear resolution:

\begin{equation}
t_i = \begin{cases}
-\text{round}(10^{(\log_{10}(60) + i \cdot \frac{\log_{10}(1440) - \log_{10}(60)}{N_{log}-1})}) & \text{for } i = 0, 1, \ldots, N_{log}-1 \text{ (logarithmic)} \\
-60 + j & \text{for } j = 0, 1, \ldots, 70 \text{ (linear)}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

This approach provided (i) Logarithmic sampling from -1440 to -60 minutes with progressively denser resolution approaching seizure onset and (ii) Minute-by-minute linear sampling from -60 to +10 minutes capturing critical peri-ictal and early ictal dynamics.

The complete set of 127 temporal sampling points (in minutes relative to seizure onset) comprised: -1440, -1360, -1285, -1214, -1147, -1084, -1024, -967, -914, -864, -816, -771, -728, -688, -650, -614, -580, -548, -518, -489, -462, -437, -413, -390, -368, -348, -329, -311, -293, -277, -262, -247, -234, -221, -209, -197, -186, -176, -166, -157, -148, -140, -132, -125, -118, -112, -105, -99, -94, -89, -84, -79, -75, -71, -67, -63, -60, -59, ..., -1, 0, 1, ..., 10.


\subsection{Definitions of Seizure Period}

Based on the standard of Epilepsy studies (\cite{Kuhlmann2018}), seizure periods were defined as follows: baseline period ($BL_{-1440--240}$) spanning 24 hours to 4 hours before seizure onset, early preictal period ($PI_{-240--60}$) from 4 hours to 1 hour before seizure onset, mid preictal period ($PI_{-60--30}$) covering 60 to 30 minutes before seizure onset, immediate preictal period ($PI_{-30--10}$) from 30 to 10 minutes before seizure onset, critical preictal period ($PI_{-10--1}$) spanning 10 to 1 minute before seizure onset, and ictal period ($I_{0-10}$) from seizure onset to 10 minutes post-onset. This temporal partitioning enables characterization of seizure-related brain state transitions across multiple time scales, from circadian-level changes to minute-by-minute dynamics approaching seizure onset.

This temporal partitioning enables characterization of seizure-related brain state transitions across multiple time scales, from circadian-level changes to minute-by-minute dynamics approaching seizure onset.

\subsection{Definitions of Interictal Control}

For each Type 1 seizure, an equal number of interictal control segments were randomly sampled from the available seizure-free periods (>4 hours from any Type 1 seizure), ensuring balanced representation in subsequent classification analyses. Control segments (Interictal Control) were matched for time of day to account for patient-specific circadian seizure occurrence \cite{loddenkemper2011chrono} \cite{loddenkemper2011circad} \cite{karoly_circadian_2017}.


\subsection{Phase-Amplitude Coupling Calculation}
\subsubsection{gPAC: GPU-Accelerated Implementation}
PAC strength was quantified using the modulation index (MI) \cite{Tort} following the Shannon entropy-based formulation: MI = 1 + $\\sum$(p $\\times$ log(p))/log(N), where p represents the normalized amplitude distribution across N phase bins and N = 18 bins (20° per bin). Computation was performed using a custom, standalone GPU-accelerated package (https://github.com/ywatanabe1989/gPAC) built on PyTorch with full vectorization across all frequency combinations. The implementation achieved approximately 100-fold speed improvement compared to conventional CPU-based methods through: (1) massive tensor operations eliminating nested loops, (2) optimized memory allocation utilizing up to 320GB total VRAM across multiple GPU nodes, and (3) batch processing with fp16 precision where appropriate. Processing leveraged the Spartan HPC system's distributed GPU architecture \hlref{Spartan} with automatic multi-GPU parallelization. Statistical significance was established using 200 surrogate datasets generated through circular phase shuffling, with PAC values z-score normalized relative to the surrogate distribution to eliminate spurious coupling.

	For each 1-minute non-overlapping time window, PAC was computed between 25 phase frequency bands (2.0-30.0 Hz) and 25 amplitude frequency bands (60.0-180.0 Hz), resulting in a 625-element PAC matrix per channel per time point. Frequency bands were generated using field-standard adaptive bandwidths: phase bands employed bandwidth = f/2 (e.g., 10 Hz center frequency spans 7.5-12.5 Hz), while amplitude bands used bandwidth = f/4 (e.g., 100 Hz center frequency spans 87.5-112.5 Hz). This approach yielded phase bands with bandwidths ranging from 0.5 Hz to 11.9 Hz and amplitude bands with bandwidths from 7.5 Hz to 40.0 Hz. Phase and amplitude information were extracted through bandpass filtering followed by Hilbert transformation to obtain instantaneous phase and amplitude envelopes. MI quantified coupling strength using the Shannon entropy-based formulation across 18 phase bins (20° each):

\begin{equation}
MI = 1 + \frac{\sum_{j=1}^{N} p_j \log(p_j)}{\log(N)}
\end{equation}

where $p_j$ represents the normalized amplitude probability in phase bin $j$, and $N = 18$ indicates the number of phase bins. Values range from 0 (uniform amplitude distribution) to 1 (maximum concentration in single phase bin). PAC values were z-score normalized using 200 surrogate datasets generated through circular phase shifts to control for spurious coupling effects.

	Missing values (NaN) in PAC computations arose from NaN values in recorded ECoG signals due to limited data type (16 bit integer), edge effects in filtering, or numerical instabilities in specific frequency combinations. NaN values found in ECoG signals were replaced with 0 while NaN values in PAC data were handled as is. Features derived from PAC matrices used nanmean, nanstd, and other NaN-aware statistical functions from NumPy to ensure robust computation despite missing values.

\subsubsection{Calculation Speed of gPAC}

The gPAC implementation achieved substantial computational efficiency improvements. Single processing unit performance demonstrated 20 seconds processing time per 1-minute segment with 400 Hz sampling rate across 16 channels, 25 phase bands, and 25 amplitude bands, generating 10,000 PAC z-values with 200 surrogate datasets. Large-scale analysis acceleration was achieved through distributed parallel computation on the Spartan HPC system utilizing multi-GPU architecture with automatic load balancing. This implementation delivered approximately 100-fold speed improvement over conventional CPU methods through memory optimization utilizing 320GB total VRAM capacity across multiple nodes.

\subsubsection{PAC Descriptive Features}

From each 1-minute window with 25 phase bands, 25 amplitude bands, and 16 channels, PAC calculation generated 10,000 z-score PAC values (${PAC}_z$) and corresponding amplitude probabilities across phase bins. Considering them as general/circular distributions, we extracted 17 statistical features per time window: minimum ($\min_{{PAC}_z}$), maximum ($\max_{{PAC}_z}$), mean ($\mu_{{PAC}_z}$), standard deviation ($\sigma_{{PAC}_z}$), median ($Q_{50,{PAC}_z}$), 25th ($Q_{25,{PAC}_z}$) and 75th ($Q_{75,{PAC}_z}$) percentiles, kurtosis ($\kappa_{{PAC}_z}$), and skewness ($\gamma_{{PAC}_z}$) of PAC z-scores, plus specialized bimodality metrics from Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) fitting including Ashman's D statistic ($D_{Ashman,{PAC}_z}$), weight ratios ($w_{ratio,{PAC}_z}$), Bhattacharyya coefficient ($B_{coeff,{PAC}_z}$), and bimodality coefficient ($\beta_{coeff,{PAC}_z}$). Additionally, circular statistics of the preferred coupling phase were computed: circular mean ($\mu_{circ}$), concentration - inverse of circular variance ($\kappa_{circ}$), circular skewness ($\gamma_{circ}$), and circular kurtosis ($\kappa_{4,circ}$).

%% \subsection{Database Architecture and Storage}
%% Processed PAC data were organized in patient-specific SQLite3 databases with hierarchical structure optimized for HPC storage allocation and concurrent write operations to maximize parallel computation efficiency. Each database contained three primary components: (1) metadata tables storing patient demographics, seizure annotations, and processing parameters; (2) PAC data tables with zlib-compressed binary large objects (BLOBs) achieving \hl{70-90\%} storage reduction; (3) quality assurance tables tracking computation timestamps, software versions, and validation metrics. The database schema enabled efficient retrieval of specific temporal windows, frequency bands, or statistical measures without loading complete datasets into memory. Database operations were handled using the scitex.db module, a custom database interface optimized for scientific computing workflows.

%% 	Data integrity was ensured through transaction-based writes with automatic rollback on errors, regular consistency checks comparing stored and computed checksums, and version control of all processing scripts with git-based tracking.

The NeuroVista dataset \cite{kuhlmann_epilepsyecosystemorg_2018} comprised continuous intracranial electroencephalogram recordings from 15 patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy, totaling 4.1 TB of data collected over monitoring periods ranging from 6 months to 2 years (\ref{fig:demographic_data}A). Analysis focused on 1,539 Type 1 clinical seizures with verified clinical manifestations across all patients. The dataset provided XX patient-years of continuous recording (mean: XX months per patient, range: 6-14 months). Processing generated 10,000 PAC z-values per 1-minute window (25 phase bands × 25 amplitude bands × 16 channels), yielding 625 frequency-pair combinations per channel (\ref{fig:demographic_data}B). From these PAC matrices, 17 statistical descriptive features were extracted per time window, resulting in comprehensive temporal profiles spanning from 24 hours before seizure onset to 10 minutes post-onset using hybrid logarithmic-linear sampling (127 time points total). Interictal controls were defined from >4h seizures, matching the number of events and time of day (\ref{fig:demographic_data}C).

\subsection{Time-dependent Pre-ictal PAC features}
By treating PAC values as distributions, we computed 17 descriptive metrics\footnote{minimum ($\min_{{PAC}_z}$), maximum ($\max_{{PAC}_z}$), mean ($\mu_{{PAC}_z}$), standard deviation ($\sigma_{{PAC}_z}$), median ($Q_{50,{PAC}_z}$), 25th ($Q_{25,{PAC}_z}$) and 75th ($Q_{75,{PAC}_z}$) percentiles, kurtosis ($\kappa_{{PAC}_z}$), and skewness ($\gamma_{{PAC}_z}$) of PAC z-scores; Ashman's D statistic ($D_{Ashman,{PAC}_z}$), weight ratios ($w_{ratio,{PAC}_z}$), Bhattacharyya coefficient ($B_{coeff,{PAC}_z}$), and bimodality coefficient ($\beta_{coeff,{PAC}_z}$) from GMM fitting; circular mean ($\mu_{circ}$), concentration - inverse of circular variance ($\kappa_{circ}$), circular skewness ($\gamma_{circ}$), and circular kurtosis ($\kappa_{4,circ}$)} (\ref{fig:pac_basic}A). Brunner-Munzel tests were performed on descriptive metrics comparing seizure and interictal control groups across pre-seizure time windows\footnote{[-1370, -730), [-730, -310), [-310, -150), [-150, -70), [-70, -30), [-30, -10), [-10, -1) minutes relative to seizure onset} (\ref{fig:pac_basic}B). Linear regression analysis of effect size across preictal time bins demonstrated R² values exceeding 0.50 in 10 of 15 patients, indicating progressive accumulation of PAC feature changes toward seizure onset with patient-specific variability.
                  
\subsection{Seizure Pseudo-prospective Prediction Performance}
Seizure prediction models achieved balanced accuracy of XX.X ± XX.X\% across 15 patients using [BEST PERFORMING ALGORITHM]. ROC-AUC values ranged from XX.X to XX.X (mean: XX.X ± XX.X), with [NUMBER] patients exceeding 0.70 threshold for clinical utility. Sensitivity reached XX.X ± XX.X\% while maintaining specificity of XX.X ± XX.X\%.

Time-in-warning analysis demonstrated XX.X ± XX.X\% average duration under high-risk advisory states. False positive rates averaged XX.X alarms per hour (range: XX.X - XX.X), with [NUMBER] patients meeting clinical acceptability criteria (FPR/h ≤ 0.2).

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Principal Findings}
...
% \subsection{Principal Findings}
% Our comprehensive analysis of phase-amplitude coupling in long-term iEEG recordings from the NeuroVista dataset reveals several key insights into seizure dynamics and prediction. The observation of progressive PAC enhancement during the pre-ictal period, particularly in theta/alpha-gamma coupling, supports the hypothesis that seizures arise from a gradual transition in network dynamics rather than sudden, unpredictable events. This finding has important implications for the development of seizure warning systems and our understanding of epileptogenesis.

% \subsection{Mechanisms of PAC in Seizure Generation}
% The dominant theta-gamma PAC pattern observed in our study aligns with established theories of cortical information processing and pathological synchronization in epilepsy. Low-frequency oscillations (theta/alpha) are thought to coordinate activity across distributed neural populations, while high-frequency gamma oscillations reflect local processing and neuronal firing. The increased coupling strength during pre-ictal periods suggests a pathological enhancement of this coordination mechanism, potentially reflecting:

% 1. \textbf{Network hypersynchronization}: Progressive recruitment of neuronal populations into synchronized states
% 2. \textbf{Excitation-inhibition imbalance}: Failure of inhibitory control mechanisms leading to runaway excitation
% 3. \textbf{Critical state transitions}: Approach to a bifurcation point in neural dynamics

% The spatial spread of PAC elevation from focal to distributed patterns mirrors the clinical evolution from focal onset to secondary generalization, providing an electrophysiological correlate of seizure propagation.

% \subsection{Clinical Translation and Implementation}
% The robust discrimination between interictal and pre-ictal states using PAC features (mean AUC > 0.XX) demonstrates clinical potential for seizure forecasting. Key advantages of PAC-based prediction include:

% \textbf{Computational efficiency}: Our PyTorch-accelerated implementation enables real-time processing suitable for implantable devices with limited computational resources. The modulation index calculation requires only basic signal processing operations implementable in low-power hardware.

% \textbf{Interpretability}: Unlike black-box machine learning approaches, PAC provides physiologically meaningful features that clinicians can interpret in the context of known seizure mechanisms.

% \textbf{Stability}: The use of z-scored PAC values normalized to patient-specific baselines accounts for inter-individual variability and electrode placement differences, improving generalizability.

% \subsection{Limitations and Methodological Considerations}

% Several limitations should be considered when interpreting our results:

% \textbf{Patient selection bias}: The NeuroVista trial included patients with focal epilepsy suitable for implantation, potentially limiting generalizability to other epilepsy types. The requirement for >10 lead seizures during the training period may select for patients with more predictable seizure patterns.

% \textbf{Electrode coverage}: The 16-channel arrays provide limited spatial sampling compared to high-density recordings. PAC patterns in regions distant from electrodes may be missed, potentially explaining performance variability across patients.

% \textbf{Stationarity assumptions}: Our analysis assumes relative stationarity of PAC patterns over the recording period. However, factors such as medication changes, sleep deprivation, or device-tissue interface evolution could introduce non-stationarities affecting long-term performance.

% \textbf{Multiple comparisons}: Despite Bonferroni correction, the analysis of multiple frequency band pairs and time windows increases false discovery risk. Future studies should consider false discovery rate (FDR) control methods.

% \subsection{Comparison with Previous Studies}
% Our findings extend previous PAC studies in epilepsy in several ways:

% Compared to Edakawa et al. (2016), who reported high-frequency oscillation (HFO) coupling in shorter recordings, our long-term analysis reveals slower dynamics and circadian modulation not observable in brief recordings.

% Unlike Amiri et al. (2016), who focused on single seizures, our large-scale analysis (>1,500 seizures) provides statistical power to identify consistent patterns and account for seizure-to-seizure variability.

% Our improvement over traditional features (+XX\% AUC vs spectral power) is consistent with Jacobs et al. (2018), though our continuous monitoring approach offers advantages for real-world implementation.

% \subsection{Future Directions}

% Several avenues warrant further investigation:

% \textbf{Adaptive algorithms}: Implementing online learning to adapt to non-stationary dynamics and improve long-term stability.

% \textbf{Multi-modal integration}: Combining PAC with other biomarkers (HFOs, connectivity measures, behavioral sensors) may further improve prediction accuracy.

% \textbf{Mechanism-based interventions}: Understanding PAC dynamics could inform closed-loop stimulation protocols that disrupt pre-ictal buildup.

% \textbf{Generalization to other epilepsy types}: Extending analysis to generalized epilepsies and pediatric populations.

% \textbf{Optimization of electrode placement}: Using PAC maps to guide surgical planning and optimize electrode positioning for monitoring and stimulation.

% \subsection{Implications for Seizure Advisory Systems}
% The successful pseudo-prospective evaluation demonstrates feasibility for clinical implementation. A PAC-based advisory system could provide:
% - Early warnings (XX minutes) for XX\% of seizures
% - Low false positive rates (XX per day) minimizing alarm fatigue
% - Personalized risk assessments based on individual PAC patterns

\subsection{Clinical implementation feasibility}
\subsubsection{Computational Speed}
   - Total processing latency: 110 seconds per minute
     - Data acquisition and transfer: 15 seconds
     - PAC computation: 30 seconds
     - Result transmission: 5 seconds
     - Buffer time: 60 seconds

% Integration with existing seizure detection algorithms and consideration of circadian patterns could further enhance performance.

% \subsection{Conclusion}
% This comprehensive analysis of phase-amplitude coupling in long-term iEEG recordings provides robust evidence for PAC as a biomarker of seizure susceptibility. The progressive enhancement of theta-gamma coupling during pre-ictal periods offers both mechanistic insights and practical applications for seizure prediction. Our optimized computational pipeline and systematic database management approach enable scalable analysis applicable to next-generation implantable devices. While patient-specific variability remains a challenge, the consistent patterns across multiple seizures and patients support the clinical translation of PAC-based seizure forecasting systems. Future work should focus on real-time implementation, algorithm adaptation, and integration with therapeutic interventions to improve quality of life for patients with drug-resistant epilepsy.
