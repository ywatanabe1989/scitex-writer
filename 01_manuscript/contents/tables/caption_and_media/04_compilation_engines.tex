%% Compilation Engines Table
\caption{\textbf{Compilation Engine Performance Characteristics.}
Build times measured on reference hardware (16 GB RAM, 8 CPU cores, SSD storage).
Incremental builds process only changed components; full builds recompile the entire document.
Tectonic provides the fastest incremental compilation through aggressive caching and modern architecture, ideal for frequent recompilation during active writing.
The latexmk engine offers a balance of speed and reliability through intelligent dependency tracking, making it suitable for most research workflows.
Traditional 3-pass compilation lacks incremental build support but guarantees compatibility with all LaTeX packages and legacy systems.}
