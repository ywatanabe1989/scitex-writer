%% Environment Variables Table
\caption{\textbf{Environment Variables for System Configuration.}
Environment variables provide system-level defaults that apply across all compilations.
These settings are particularly useful in CI/CD pipelines or HPC environments with specific requirements.
The \texttt{SCITEX\_ENGINE} variable provides the highest priority override for engine selection, superseding both YAML configuration and command-line arguments.
Variables can be set persistently in shell configuration (\texttt{.bashrc}, \texttt{.zshrc}) or temporarily for single runs (\texttt{SCITEX\_VERBOSE=true ./compile\_manuscript.sh}).}
