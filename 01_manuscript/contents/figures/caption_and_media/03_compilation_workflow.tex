%% Compilation Workflow Diagram
\caption{\textbf{SciTeX Writer Compilation Workflow.}
This flowchart illustrates the complete compilation pipeline from initial dependency checking through final PDF generation.
The system automatically detects and uses the best available compilation engine (Tectonic for speed, latexmk for reliability, or 3-pass for maximum compatibility).
Parallel processing of figures and tables significantly reduces compilation time.
Optional features include automatic diff generation for revision tracking and file watching for hot-recompile mode.
Color coding: green (start/end), orange (engine selection), blue (preprocessing), purple (parallel processing), gray (decision points).}
