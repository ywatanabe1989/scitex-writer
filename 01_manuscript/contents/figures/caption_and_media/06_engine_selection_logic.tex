%% Engine Selection Logic Diagram
\caption{\textbf{Compilation Engine Selection Decision Tree.}
The system prioritizes explicit user configuration over automatic detection.
Environment variables provide the highest priority override (useful for CI/CD pipelines).
Command-line arguments (--engine) override YAML configuration (useful for one-off compilations).
When engine is set to 'auto' (default), the system attempts to use Tectonic first for speed, falling back to latexmk for reliability, and finally to 3-pass for maximum compatibility.
This cascading detection ensures the system always finds an available compilation method while preferring faster engines when possible.
Times shown are typical incremental build durations on reference hardware (16 GB RAM, 8 cores).}
