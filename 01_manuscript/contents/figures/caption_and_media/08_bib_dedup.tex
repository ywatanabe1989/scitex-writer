%% Bibliography Deduplication Workflow
\caption{\textbf{Multi-File Bibliography Processing and Deduplication.}
The bibliography system enables researchers to organize references across multiple topical .bib files.
All files in the \texttt{00\_shared/bib\_files/} directory are automatically merged during compilation.
The deduplication engine implements a two-tier matching strategy: DOI-based matching provides exact duplicate detection when DOIs are present, while title and year matching handles entries without DOIs.
This approach eliminates duplicate references that commonly appear when the same paper is cited across multiple source files.
The final bibliography is sorted according to the selected citation style (by citation order for numbered styles, alphabetically for author-year styles).
Color coding: blue (merging), purple (deduplication logic), green (output).}
