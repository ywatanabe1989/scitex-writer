%% Directory Structure Diagram
\caption{\textbf{SciTeX Writer Directory Organization.}
This diagram shows the hierarchical organization of the repository structure.
The \texttt{00\_shared/} directory (green) contains resources used across all document types, including bibliography files and LaTeX styles, ensuring consistency without duplication.
The three document directories (blue/purple) follow identical internal structures, facilitating familiarity and code reuse.
Each document has its own \texttt{contents/} subdirectory with \texttt{figures/} and \texttt{tables/} organized into \texttt{caption\_and\_media/} (source files) and \texttt{compiled/} (generated LaTeX code).
The modular structure minimizes merge conflicts during collaborative editing by isolating frequently-modified content files.
Compilation scripts (orange) and configuration files (red) reside in dedicated directories for easy discovery and maintenance.
Dotted lines indicate that supplementary materials follow the same organizational pattern as the main manuscript.}
