%% Feature Overview Mind Map
\caption{\textbf{SciTeX Writer Feature Overview.}
This mind map provides a comprehensive visualization of the framework's major capabilities organized into five categories.
Compilation features include multi-engine support with auto-detection and performance optimization modes.
Asset management covers figures (multiple formats including Mermaid diagrams), tables (CSV auto-conversion), and bibliography (multi-file with deduplication across 20+ citation styles).
Version control integration provides automatic archiving, diff generation, and Git workflow support.
Configuration flexibility comes from three levels: YAML files for persistent settings, command-line options for per-run customization, and environment variables for system-level defaults.
Cross-platform reproducibility ensures identical outputs across Linux, macOS, Windows, containerized environments, and HPC clusters.}
