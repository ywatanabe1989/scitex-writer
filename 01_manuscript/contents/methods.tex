\section{Methods}

This section describes your research methodology. Replace this placeholder text with detailed descriptions of your experimental design, data collection, and analysis procedures.

\subsection{Study Design}

Describe your overall experimental or computational design. Include information about:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Study type (experimental, observational, computational, etc.)
    \item Sample selection criteria
    \item Ethical approvals and informed consent procedures
    \item Timeline and study phases
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data Collection}

Detail how you collected your data:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Data sources and acquisition methods
    \item Instruments or tools used
    \item Sampling procedures
    \item Quality control measures
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data Analysis}

Explain your analytical approach:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Statistical methods employed
    \item Software and computational tools used
    \item Processing pipelines
    \item Significance thresholds and corrections for multiple comparisons
\end{itemize}

Provide enough detail that other researchers could reproduce your work. Reference any novel methods or modifications to existing protocols \cite{example_method_2019}.
