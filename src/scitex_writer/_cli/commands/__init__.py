"""Command registry for the scitex-writer CLI.

Importing this package imports every command module for its side effect:
each module's ``@main_group.command`` / ``@main_group.group`` decorators run
at import time and register onto the root group in ``.._core``. After all
modules are imported, the post-registration wiring runs (top-level aliases,
optional scitex_dev subcommands, shell completion, skills, containers).

# Imported from the PUBLIC `scitex_dev.cli` (it is in that module's __all__,
# behind a deliberate lazy re-export), not the private `_cli._completion`.
# A peer can move a private module without notice; the public name is the
# promise.
#
# NO ImportError GUARD. scitex-dev is a HARD dependency of writer, so it is
# always installed — a guard here would not be protecting against a missing
# optional package, it would be SWALLOWING a real breakage: if the peer ever
# drops or renames this symbol, shell completion would silently stop existing
# and nothing would say why. Let it raise.
