"""scitex-writer CLI (Click-based, audit-compliant).

Thin orchestrator: the root group + dispatch live in ``._core`` and the
command groups live in ``.commands`` (imported here for its registration
side effect). This preserves the entry point ``scitex_writer._cli:main``
and the ``_cli.py`` re-export.

Subcommand groups:
    mcp        - MCP server commands
    guidelines - IMRAD writing guidelines (abstract/introduction/methods/...)
    prompts    - Action prompts (Asta)
    compile    - Compile LaTeX to PDF (manuscript/supplementary/revision/content)
    export     - Export manuscript for submission
    bib        - Bibliography management
    tables     - Table management
    figures    - Figure management
    gui        - Browser-based editor
    update     - Update engine files in a project
    migration  - Import/export Overleaf
    introspect - Python package introspection

Top-level convenience commands:
    list-python-apis   - alias for `introspect api scitex_writer`
    show-usage         - print the long usage guide

All LaTeX-domain command names (`compile manuscript`, `bib`, `figures`,
`tables`, etc.) are preserved verbatim — they are the canonical vocabulary
of the package and are referenced from skills, READMEs, and external docs.

# Fast-path a bare ``--version`` / ``-V`` BEFORE importing ``.commands``.
#
# Root cause this guards against (fixes the CI regression that appeared once
# scitex-dev 0.27.0 was installed): importing ``.commands`` eagerly pulls in
# ``scitex_dev.cli.attach_shell_completion`` to attach the shell-completion
# leaves. That public name lazily re-exports from ``scitex_dev._cli._completion``,
# so the same import chain still reaches ``scitex_dev._cli`` — and *that*
# package's ``__init__`` has its own
# module-level fast-path that, when ``sys.argv[1:]`` is a bare
# ``--version``/``-V``, prints ``scitex-dev <ver>`` and ``raise
# SystemExit(0)``. So without this guard, ``scitex-writer --version`` (and
# ``python -m scitex_writer --version``) print scitex-dev's version and exit
# before scitex-writer's own Click ``version_option`` (in ``._core``) ever
# runs.
#
# We short-circuit here — before that import chain — so scitex-writer's own
# version wins. The output matches Click's ``version_option`` format (and the
# ``prog_name="scitex-writer"`` set in ``._core``), so behaviour is identical
# to a normal Click ``--version`` dispatch. Deliberately narrow: any other
# argv (a subcommand, ``--version --json``, ``--help``, ``-h``) falls through
# to the real Click group unchanged.
