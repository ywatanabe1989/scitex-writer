"""Why the scitex-app workspace shell is unavailable, stated precisely.

An ``except ImportError`` around ``scitex_app.embed`` catches two different
failures and cannot tell them apart:

- scitex-app is ABSENT, or
- scitex-app is PRESENT but predates ``.embed`` (added in 0.4.0).

Reporting the first when the second is true sends the reader to
``pip show scitex-app``, where the package is sitting right there — so the
message reads as a lie and they go debug something else. The remedy is the
same for both, but the diagnosis is not, and a wrong diagnosis costs more
than a missing one.

The decision is a pure function of two facts so it can be tested against real
values; only ``probe_missing_shell`` touches the interpreter.
