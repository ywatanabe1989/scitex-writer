"""scitex-writer's native system (apt) dependency provider.

scitex-writer is the single source of truth for its own LaTeX apt packages —
an image build installs from this list instead of hardcoding it. The set
mirrors the proven scripts/containers/texlive.def recipe.

Registered as a ``scitex_dev.system_deps`` entry-point so
``scitex-dev ecosystem system-deps`` can aggregate it across leaves; the
uniform ``scitex-writer dev system-deps list|install`` CLI verb wraps it (added
with the _cli split). Standalone interim emit (no scitex-dev needed)::

    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends $(python -m scitex_writer._core._system_deps)

NOTE: bibtex (texlive-bibtex-extra) is the default natbib bibliography path,
matching texlive.def. ``biber`` is also included so biblatex-based manuscripts
compile out of the box -- it does NOT change the default engine (an
operator/config choice). NOTE: a manuscript using `bashful` must compile with
``--shell-escape`` (a compile flag, not an apt package).
