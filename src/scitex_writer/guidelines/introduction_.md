# Introduction Guideline

## Aim of Introduction
The aim of introduction is to offer readers with the background necessary to understand your paper: the status of knowledge in your field, the question motivating your work and its significance, how you sought to answer that question (methods), and your main findings.

## Rules
Introduction must:
- Follow the format of the template below.
- Conform to the language style typical of a scholarly article in the field.
- Use technical language suitable for the target journal.
- Spell out abbreviations and acronyms in their first appearance.
- Include a clear, concise topic sentence in each paragraph.
- Use transition phrases between paragraphs to make introduction coherent and cohesive.
- Explicitly indicate species with sample sizes.
- Maintain quantitative measurements as they are written.
- Avoid unnecessary adjectives like "significantly", "well".
- Use LaTeX format.
- Ensure at least 1000 words.

## TEMPLATE

[1. Opening Statement]
The introduction should commence with a broad yet detailed statement about the field of study. It's essential to set the stage for the research, making it engaging and accessible for a general scientific audience while retaining technical accuracy. This part is the first half of the opening paragraph.

[2. Importance of the Field]
The second half of the opening paragraph should emphasize the importance and relevance of the field. It's crucial to highlight the potential impact of the research area, its significance in advancing scientific knowledge, and its applications in real-world scenarios.

[3. Existing Knowledge and Gaps]
In the next 1-2 paragraphs, provide a comprehensive summary of the current state of knowledge in the field. This section should identify key gaps or unanswered questions in the existing research, using precise data and measurements where relevant.

[4. Limitations in Previous Works]
In the next 1-2 paragraphs, critically examine the limitations inherent in previous research within the field. Discuss methodological constraints and logical shortcomings or gaps in previous studies.

[5. Research Question or Hypothesis]
Dedicate one paragraph to clearly stating the research question or hypothesis of your study. This should be specific, directly related to the gaps identified, and framed in a way that highlights its significance.

[6. Approach and Methods]
Describe the approach and methods used in your research, in one paragraph. This section should give an overview of the methods without delving into excessive detail. Highlight the superiority of current study over existing works.

[7. Overview of Results]
Optionally, include a paragraph providing a high-level summary of the main findings. This should avoid detailed data but effectively convey the overall outcomes.

[8. Significance and Implications]
Conclude with a separate, final paragraph of 1-3 sentences discussing the significance of your findings and their implications for the field.

## Examples

For example, the introduction below is well-written, following the provided template.

[START of 1. Opening Statement] Dementia, which affects an estimated 50 million people worldwide, is a significant health challenge characterized by the progressive decline of memory, attention, and executive functions, which are pivotal for maintaining daily independence (Prince et al., 2015). [END of 1. Opening Statement] [START of 2. Importance of the Field] Accurate identification of its various subtypes, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH), is crucial for appropriate clinical management (Barker et al., 2002; Williams and Malm, 2016; McKeith et al., 2017). [END of 2. Importance of the Field]

[START of 4. Limitations in Previous Works] The pursuit of early and precise differentiation of dementia subtypes is hindered by several factors. Traditional diagnostic techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tests, while effective, are costly, invasive, and not universally accessible, limiting their utility in certain regions (Garn et al., 2017; Hata et al., 2023). [END of 4. Limitations in Previous Works]

[START of 5. Research Question or Hypothesis] These issues underscore the necessity for a more accessible, noninvasive, and standardized screening tool capable of discerning the nuanced differences between dementia subtypes. [END of 5. Research Question or Hypothesis]

[START of 6. Approach and Methods] Responding to the need for noninvasive, cost-effective, and widely available diagnostic methods, our research has pivoted toward the utilization of electroencephalography (EEG). This neurophysiological recording technique, renowned for its noninvasiveness and cost-effectiveness, holds untapped potential for enhancing the early detection and differentiation of dementia.
