# Methods Guideline

## Aim of Methods
The purpose of the methods section is to provide a detailed account of the research process so that readers can evaluate the study's validity and reliability. The methods section also serves as a blueprint for the study, helping other researchers replicate the findings.

## Rules
Methods must:
- Focus on reproducible procedures.
- Use passive sentences to indicate that the study can be reproduced by anyone.
- Avoid unnecessary expressions.
- Conform to the language style typical of a scholarly article in the field.
- Use technical language suitable for the target journal.
- Spell out abbreviations and acronyms in their first appearance.
- Include a clear, concise topic sentence in each paragraph.
- Use transition phrases between paragraphs for coherence.
- Explicitly indicate species with sample sizes.
- Maintain quantitative measurements as they are written.
- Use LaTeX format.
- Ensure at least 1000 words.

## TEMPLATE

[1. Study Design]
Describe the overall study design (e.g., randomized controlled trial, cohort study, cross-sectional study). Include the rationale for choosing this design.

[2. Participants/Subjects]
Describe the study population, including inclusion and exclusion criteria, recruitment methods, and sample size justification.

[3. Materials/Equipment]
List and describe the materials, equipment, or instruments used. Include manufacturer information and specifications where relevant.

[4. Procedures]
Describe the experimental procedures in chronological order. Provide enough detail for replication. Include timing, dosages, and conditions.

[5. Data Collection]
Describe how data were collected, including measurement instruments, their validity and reliability, and data quality control measures.

[6. Data Analysis]
Describe statistical methods used, including software and version. Specify significance levels and any corrections for multiple comparisons.

[7. Ethical Considerations]
Include statements about ethical approval, informed consent, and any relevant declarations.

[START of 1. Study Design] This was a multi-center, prospective cohort study conducted across five academic medical centers between January 2020 and December 2023. The cohort design was selected to enable longitudinal tracking of disease progression. [END of 1. Study Design]

[START of 2. Participants/Subjects] Participants were recruited from outpatient neurology clinics. Inclusion criteria were: age 60-85 years, Mini-Mental State Examination score > 20, and ability to provide informed consent. Exclusion criteria included history of stroke, traumatic brain injury, or psychiatric disorders. A total of 450 participants were enrolled (n = 150 per group). [END of 2. Participants/Subjects]

[START of 4. Procedures] EEG recordings were obtained using a 64-channel system (Brain Products GmbH, Germany) with electrodes placed according to the international 10-20 system. Recordings were performed in a sound-attenuated, electrically shielded room with participants seated comfortably. Each session lasted approximately 30 minutes. [END of 4. Procedures]

[START of 6. Data Analysis] Statistical analyses were performed using Python 3.9 with SciPy 1.7.0. Group differences were assessed using one-way ANOVA with Tukey's post-hoc tests. Significance was set at p < 0.05, with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. [END of 6. Data Analysis]
