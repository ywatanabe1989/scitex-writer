r"""The LaTeX half of the figure pipeline (port of ``04_compilation.src``).

Everything that writes ``.tex``, in the order ``process`` runs it:

* :func:`compile_legends`          -- ``compiled_dir/NN_*.tex`` from the caption bodies.
* :func:`handle_figure_visibility` -- the ``.figures_enabled`` marker.
* :func:`compile_figure_tex_files` -- assemble ``FINAL.tex`` + the ``_placeable/`` copies.

Two behaviours the shell pinned and this port keeps verbatim:

* the NO-figures fallback header emits **no figure float** -- only LaTeX comments;
  base.tex is the single source of the "Figures" ``\section*`` / ``\pdfbookmark``,
  so an empty-figures manuscript shows that title exactly once, not twice;
* an end-block float is GUARDED by ``\ifcsname scitexfigplaced@<n>``, so a figure
  placed inline with ``\scitexfig{<n>}`` is not also duplicated at the end.

One behaviour deliberately changed: image paths are ALWAYS absolute. The shell
switched to absolute only for tectonic (which cannot resolve a relative graphics
path) and left every other engine on a cwd-relative path that broke whenever the
compile ran from another directory. Absolute is correct for all engines and drops
the engine-conditional branch entirely.
