r"""The figure pipeline: a pure-Python port of ``process_figures.sh``.

Ports the shell module (plus every ``.src`` under ``process_figures_modules/``)
stage for stage, reading the SAME config keys the shell read via ``yq``:
``figures.dir``, ``figures.caption_media_dir``, ``figures.jpg_dir``,
``figures.compiled_dir``, ``figures.compiled_file`` and the optional
``figures.max_height_frac`` from ``config/config_<doc_type>.yaml``.

This module is the ORCHESTRATOR: it resolves and boundary-checks the configured
paths, then runs the media stages (:mod:`._figures_media`) followed by the LaTeX
stages (:mod:`._figures_tex`) in the shell's order --

    init -> lowercase panel ids -> drop panel captions -> ensure captions
         -> convert cascade -> compose panels -> link JPGs -> placeholders
         -> [crop] -> compile legends -> visibility marker -> assemble FINAL.tex

Three shell behaviours this port deliberately CHANGES. Each replaced a SILENT
degradation, never a working path:

* ONE image backend (Pillow, :mod:`scitex_writer._utils._figure_image`) instead of
  the ``magick``/``convert``/``mogrify``/``montage`` cascade, every rung of which
  fell through silently when its binary was absent -- crop became a no-op and
  tiling ``cp``-ed the first panel and called it a composite;
* panels are really TILED into their composite. The shell's
  ``copy_composed_jpg_files`` ``cp``-ed panel *a* to ``NN.jpg`` "for now", and its
  ``auto_tile_panels`` scanned ``jpg_for_compilation`` -- which by construction
  never holds panels, because the linking step skips them -- so the montage path
  was dead code and every panelled figure shipped as its first panel;
* an absent converter (``libreoffice`` for PPTX, ``mmdc`` for Mermaid) FAILS LOUD
  with an install hint when such a source is actually present, instead of warning
  and leaving the figure's ``.jpg`` missing -- which breaks ``\includegraphics``
  much later with an error pointing nowhere near the real cause.

Robust by construction: pathlib only (never shells out to find/rm/mv); every write
target is resolved and asserted to live INSIDE the project root; fail-loud
(explicit error dict + actionable hint) on a missing project dir / config.
