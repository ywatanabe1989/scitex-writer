r"""Ground-truth page count of a PDF a compile run just produced.

This is the discriminator between the two outcomes a NON-ZERO engine exit can
hide:

* **produced a PDF** -- pdfTeX finalized a complete document and only a
  *warning-grade* problem (typically a non-fatal ``bibtex`` error on a stub
  entry, which makes ``latexmk`` exit 12) made the engine return non-zero. The
  artifact is usable and must NOT be destroyed.
* **produced nothing** -- the run really failed. There is no PDF, or the file on
  disk is a stale leftover / a zero-page husk. This must still fail loud.

``pages > 0`` is the line between them, and it is deliberately established from
the *LaTeX log of this run* first: pdfTeX writes

    Output written on <path> (7 pages, 129061 bytes).

ONLY when it finalized a PDF during that run, so the line cannot be inherited
from an earlier successful compile the way a stale ``.pdf`` on disk can. The raw
PDF byte scan is the fallback for when the log is absent or was cleaned.
