\authorText{We thank the Editor for this helpful summary. We have carefully addressed all reviewer concerns through the following revisions:}

\authorText{1) Added comprehensive performance benchmarks in the Supplementary Results section, including compilation times across different system configurations and scalability analysis with varying document sizes.}

\authorText{2) Expanded the Discussion section to include detailed comparison with existing solutions (Overleaf, traditional LaTeX installations, and template repositories), clearly articulating the distinct advantages of our containerized approach.}

\authorText{3) Acknowledged the learning curve for command-line interfaces in the Limitations section and proposed future directions including optional graphical interfaces and expanded documentation for LaTeX newcomers.}

\authorText{4) Provided cross-platform validation results demonstrating byte-for-byte reproducibility across six different operating systems and two processor architectures.}
