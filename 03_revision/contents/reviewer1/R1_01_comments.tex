\editorText{The manuscript describes an interesting approach to scientific manuscript preparation using containerization. However, I am concerned about the computational overhead introduced by container startup times. The authors should provide detailed performance benchmarks comparing compilation times with and without containerization, across different document sizes and system configurations. Without this quantitative data, it is difficult to assess whether the reproducibility benefits outweigh the performance costs.}
