\section*{Introduction}

We thank the Editor and Reviewers for their thoughtful and constructive feedback on our manuscript describing the SciTeX Writer framework. Their comments have significantly strengthened both the technical content and the clarity of our presentation. We have carefully addressed each point raised during the review process and believe the revised manuscript provides a more comprehensive and accessible description of the framework's capabilities.

\editorText{Original comments from the editor and reviewers are presented in gray italicized text.}

\authorText{Our responses to these comments are shown in blue text.}

Changes made to the manuscript text are highlighted using latexdiff formatting, with \DIFadd{additions shown in blue} and \DIFdel{deletions shown in red with strikethrough}.

This response document demonstrates one of the key features of SciTeX Writer: the structured organization of revision materials. Each reviewer's comments and our corresponding responses are maintained in separate, version-controlled files that are automatically compiled into this comprehensive response letter. The integration with latexdiff enables automatic generation of marked-up manuscripts showing precisely where changes were made. This systematic approach ensures that all reviewer concerns are addressed and documented in a format that facilitates editorial review.
