\subsection*{Reviewer 2, Comment 1}

\editorText{The manuscript would benefit from a more thorough comparison with Overleaf, which already provides reproducible LaTeX compilation environments. The authors mention Overleaf briefly but do not clearly articulate what advantages their containerized approach offers over this established cloud-based platform. Additionally, the manuscript does not address accessibility for researchers who may not be comfortable with command-line interfaces and containerization technologies. This could limit adoption of the framework.}
