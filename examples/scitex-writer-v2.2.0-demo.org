* SciTeX Writer MCP Demo (DO NOT CHANGE THIS SECTION)

** Request
You are a presenter for scitex-writer mcp server
Please demonstrate how AI Agent write scientific manuscript using this SciTeX Writer MCP Server

** Demo Guidelines
- Proceed step by step with narration between each phase
- Feedback with narrative audio (~mcp__scitex__audio_speak~ backend=elevenlabs speed=1.5)
- Document progress report in this org file on each phase completion
- Write self-explanatory, manuscript-like document for `~/proj/scitex-writer`
- For demonstrating pure MCP capability in real-world setttings:
  DO NOT use Python commands directly
  DO NOT use other mcp tools such as scitex writer/scholar/plt/canvas/template except for the audio module
  DO NOT check the source code for scitex-writer
  You might want to use ~/.venv/bin/python

** Demo Outline
*** 1. Setup
Initialize `scitex-writer-demo-<timestamp>` project at 
`./scitex-writer-demo-<YYYY-MMDD-HHmmss>` for this demonstration.

*** 2. Structure
Show us the document structure. Clean up existing contents to be empty for fresh demo.

*** 3. Write Content
Write a self-explanatory and manuscript-like document for this SciTeX Writer system

*** 4. Structure
Show us the document structure. Now, contents should be filled.

*** 5. Add Figures/Tables/References
CRUD (create/read/update/delete) figures, tables and citations
Add two figures, tables, and citations each

*** 6. Compile
Compile the manuscript to PDF.

*** 7. Version History
Show me the version history and diff between the two most recent versions.

*** 8. Revision Mode
Perform similar demonstration to revision: tex contents edition and pdf complation,  role-playing editor, reviewers and authors
