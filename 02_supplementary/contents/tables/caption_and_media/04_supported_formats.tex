%% Supported File Formats Table
\caption{\textbf{Supported File Formats and Auto-Conversion.}
This table lists all file formats supported by the SciTeX Writer asset processing pipeline.
Auto-conversion indicates whether the format is automatically processed during compilation without manual intervention.
Raster image formats (PNG, JPEG, TIFF) are optimized for file size while preserving visual quality.
Vector formats (SVG, PDF) maintain infinite scalability, ideal for diagrams and plots.
Mermaid diagram files (.mmd) are automatically rendered to images using the Mermaid CLI.
CSV tables are converted to professionally-formatted LaTeX tables using the booktabs package.
The bibliography system merges multiple .bib files and removes duplicates based on DOI or title+year matching.}
