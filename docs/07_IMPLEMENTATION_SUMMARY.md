# SciTex Implementation Summary

This document provides an overview of the SciTex implementation, highlighting key features, code organization, and recent improvements.

## Core Features

SciTex provides a comprehensive system for scientific manuscript preparation and compilation with LaTeX, featuring:

1. **Automated Figure Processing**
   - Automatic conversion between image formats (PNG, JPG, TIF, SVG)
   - Figure caption management and integration
   - One-figure-per-page layout for academic publications
   - Support for multipanel figures

2. **Table Management**
   - CSV to LaTeX table conversion
   - Table caption generation and management
   - Automatic placement and referencing

3. **Document Organization**
   - Modular file structure for content separation
   - Automatic compilation of manuscript, supplementary materials, and revisions
   - Version tracking for document evolution

4. **User Experience**
   - Clear, consistent compile commands
   - Extensive debugging information
   - Comprehensive error reporting

## Code Organization

The SciTex codebase is organized as follows:

```
SciTex/
├── compile                   # Main dispatcher script
├── compile.sh               # Modern implementation of compile script
├── docs/                    # Documentation files
├── manuscript/              # Main manuscript directory
│   ├── compile              # Manuscript-specific compilation script
│   ├── scripts/             # Supporting scripts
│   │   ├── sh/              # Shell scripts
│   │   │   └── modules/     # Modular components
│   │   └── py/              # Python utilities
│   └── contents/                 # Source content
│       ├── figures/         # Figure directory
│       └── tables/          # Table directory
├── revision/                # Revision materials
└── supplementary/           # Supplementary materials
```

## Key Modules

1. **`compile.sh`**: The main entry point for document compilation, handling argument parsing and dispatching to component-specific compilers.

2. **`process_figures.sh`**: Handles all figure-related processing, including:
   - Image format conversion
   - Caption extraction and formatting
   - Figure compilation into LaTeX
   - One-figure-per-page rendering

3. **`process_tables.sh`**: Provides table processing functionality:
   - CSV data import
   - Table formatting
   - Caption integration

4. **`gather_tex.sh`**: Consolidates all LaTeX files for compilation and diff generation.

## Recent Improvements

### 1. Figure Rendering Enhancement

Modified the figure rendering process to ensure consistent one-figure-per-page layout by:
- Changing figure placement option from `[ht]` to `[p]` to force each figure onto its own page
- Adding `\clearpage` commands between figures

### 2. Script Argument Handling

Improved clarity in script argument handling:
- Better documentation of the `--` separator for passing arguments to component scripts
- Consistent argument handling across all compilation scripts
- Clearer usage examples in help text

### 3. Error Reporting

Enhanced error reporting and feedback:
- Verbose mode for detailed progress information
- Better error messages with specific file paths for troubleshooting
- Improved feedback on figure processing statistics
- Clear warnings when no figures are found

### 4. Shell Script Robustness

Improved script robustness:
- Better error handling with specific error messages
- Detailed logging for debugging
- Proper handling of edge cases (missing files, etc.)
- Consistent parameter passing between scripts

## Future Development Priorities

1. **Documentation Standardization** - Create consistent documentation format and organization

2. **Centralized Configuration** - Implement a central configuration file for project settings

3. **SVG Support Enhancement** - Improve SVG graphics handling and integration

4. **Performance Optimization** - Enhance performance for large manuscripts with many figures

5. **Multi-panel Figure Automation** - Streamline creation and formatting of complex multi-panel figures

## Usage

For basic usage, see the `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` document. For detailed instructions on figures and tables, refer to `FIGURE_TABLE_GUIDE.md` and `TABLE_FORMAT_OPTIONS.md`.

To compile a manuscript with figures, use:

```bash
./compile -m -- -f
```

This command ensures that the `-f` flag is properly passed to the manuscript compilation script, enabling figures in the output.
