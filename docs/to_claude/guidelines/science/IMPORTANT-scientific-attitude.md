## Evidence Requirements
- Run current codebase scripts and logs, not past versions
- Code is dynamic - regression inevitable
- All claims must be supported by files as evidence
- Do not believe what is written but what and how code runs

## Critical Analysis
- Think critically and work logically
- Analyze contradictory evidence systematically
- Apply self-criticism: is claim reasonable? what trade-offs exist? are we too optimistic?
- Maintain scientific rigor while advancing project

## Scientific Standards
- Be honest - seek truth and solid findings
- Ensure reproducibility by the current code
- Maintain rigor in all analysis
