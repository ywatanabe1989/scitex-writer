# ADR 0001 — SSOT interactive research-paper editor (pen-tablet annotation + interactive clew provenance)

- **Status:** Accepted (2026-07-14). hub approved 2026-07-08; figrecipe confirmed the `figure-requests/1` field shapes; clew reviewed it against 0.17.0 and had three precisions folded. Every co-owner input this ADR was waiting on has arrived.
- **Date:** 2026-07-08 (accepted 2026-07-14)
- **Deciders:** operator, scitex-writer (lead/author), scitex-hub, figrecipe, scitex-clew, scitex-dev, scitex-ui
- **Affects:** scitex-hub, figrecipe, scitex-clew, scitex-ui, scitex-live-paper
- **Supersedes/builds on:** card `live-paper-viewer-component` (operator decisions, Telegram 553–571)

## Context

The operator wants ONE interactive research-paper PDF viewer/editor, reused across the ecosystem (Writer authoring, hub project view, Journal reading, Live Paper published), not duplicated. Three capabilities:

1. **Pen-tablet annotation → agent-feedback loop.** The operator annotates the compiled PDF with a pen (Wacom / iPad / finger); marks become structured requests routed to the responsible agent.
2. **Interactive clew provenance on the paper.** Hover a claim to light its claim → computed-output → source chain; lineage between claims; each claim colored by its source-gate verdict.
3. **Inline source-reachability feedback.** "This claim doesn't reach a source; fix + re-verify," surfaced inline as you edit.

"Live paper" is a document **state/capability**, not a destination app (operator, msgs 566–568); the interim live-paper hub tile dissolves once the capability is embedded.

## Decision

### 1. Where it lives — scitex-ui App tier, two layers

Precedent exists: **scitex-ui (`@scitex/ui`)** is the shared TS+CSS component library already consumed by scitex-hub, figrecipe, and scitex-writer (Django `INSTALLED_APPS` + `@scitex/ui`). The editor is a reusable App-tier component and belongs there — **not** a new package (fragments the shared-UI home) and **not** embedded in writer (would invert the dependency and couple hub to writer's release cadence).

- **Layer 1 — framework-neutral PDF renderer (scitex-ui).** A vanilla-TS class wrapping PDF.js that takes a container element, plus a thin React adapter. Exposes an **action-hook API**: `page`, `coords`, `region-select`, `pen-input` events (operator-specified, msgs 561–563). Used by hub's project/file view for *any* PDF. Framework-neutral is mandatory — hub's shell is vanilla-TS + Django templates; React only via adapters; no Electron.
  - **Packaging (hub flag 4):** L1 is exported from scitex-ui as a first-class **library entry at a named `exports` subpath — `@scitex/ui/pdf-viewer`** — reachable directly, NOT only through the app/shell bundle. (A missing/implicit subpath is exactly the class of mistake behind the figrecipe bridge-init break; hub's Vite bridge pins this subpath.)
- **Layer 2 — claim-aware viewer (scitex-live-paper).** Claim anchors, provenance panel + DAG, verdict coloring, re-verify — built strictly on Layer 1's event/anchor API, depending on the clew model.
- **Auto-upgrade detection (hub flag 3):** a consumer picks L1 vs L2 **without downloading/parsing the whole bundle**. The bundle spec exposes a **cheap marker** — a claims sidecar file whose *presence in the bundle listing* (or a single manifest field) signals L2 — so hub's project file view decides from the listing alone: plain PDF → L1; claims-bundle marker present → L2.

**First consumer (concrete first step):** swap Writer's existing Overleaf-style right-hand PDF pane to the shared component (Layer 1 + claim layer + hooks). (operator, msg 571)

### 2. Pen-tablet loop — generic hooks, agent-routed

- Pen input rides **Pointer Events** (covers Wacom, iPad, finger) → responsive + touch mandatory (hub mobile is an operator priority; a desktop-only viewer is rejected).
- Marks are captured by Layer 1's hook API and dispatched by the **consuming app** to the **workspace/project agent** (NOT live-paper — keep the hook surface generic).
- **Routing by target:** a mark on a **figure** = a figure-change request → **figrecipe** (its lane). A mark on a **claim / prose** = feedback into the writer/clew hints loop. (figrecipe seam contract pending figrecipe's input — see Open Questions.)
- Handwriting: pen = marks (circle/underline/arrow/box/region); text = OS dictation (voice), not an in-app OCR engine (operator's earlier steer). OCR of handwriting is out of scope for v1.

### 3. Provenance layer — join by claim_id, verdict-colored

- **Coordinate map:** PDF ↔ claim join by `claim_id`, using the same sanitize as `render_clew`. Needs per-claim PDF anchors (`\hypertarget{clew-<id>}`) — tracked in card `writer-clew-macros-hypertarget-anchors`; the web overlay locates claims by these anchors.
- **Verdict palette (hub flag 2):** the component does NOT hardcode hex. It exposes **CSS custom properties** — `--clew-verdict-verified` / `--clew-verdict-suspect` / `--clew-verdict-failed` / `--clew-verdict-exception` — with the SciTeX standard values as *defaults* (verified `#14B414` / suspect `#E6A014` / failed `#FF4632` / exception `#C832FF`), themable via scitex-ui's theme variables so the palette adapts to hub's dark/light themes. (Aesthetics are the operator-delegated province of hub; hardcoded hex would force forks.)
- **Chain data:** from clew (claims.json "1.6-unified" and/or a live query) — exact source pending clew's input.

### 4. Inline engine — two surfaces, clew/scitex-dev SoC preserved

- **Real-time inline (per-claim, as you annotate):** query **clew's per-claim grounding** directly. This is the design's **one true external dependency**. Do NOT call the whole-workdir gate per keystroke.

  **Required surface** (`is_claim_grounded(claim_location, *, workdir=".") -> Dict`, and/or `scitex-clew grounding <claim> --json`), returning `{grounded, claim_id, matched_source{path,sha256}|None, reason, fix_hint}` with `reason ∈ scitex_clew.GROUNDING_REASONS` = `{grounded, no_chain_match, no_manifest, manifest_untrusted, claim_not_found}`.

  The return is a plain **`Dict`**, not an importable type. This ADR previously wrote it as `-> GroundingVerdict`, which named a symbol Clew does not export — so a reader following the contract would write `from scitex_clew import GroundingVerdict` and get an ImportError. A contract that names a type nobody ships is the same trap as calling a function with a keyword it does not have; corrected here after verifying the real surface by import.

  **What clew ships today (0.17.0, verified by import, not by report):** `is_grounded(claim, manifest, db) -> bool` and `grounded_claim_ids(workdir, ...) -> List[str]`. These are the primitives, not the port. Two concrete gaps:
  - `is_grounded` makes the CALLER load the manifest and the DB. That is clew's internal plumbing leaking across the seam; writer must not know clew has a `SourcesManifest` or a `db`, and must not be the one to keep them in sync.
  - Both return a bare `bool` / `List[str]`. **A boolean cannot drive this UI.** The editor must distinguish amber (`no_manifest` — nothing registered yet, a compose-time convenience) from red (`manifest_untrusted` — there IS a manifest and this claim fails it), and must render a `fix_hint`. Collapsing those to `False` is precisely the "claim with provenance reported as unsourced" bug class this design exists to kill.

  Status: carded as `clew-per-claim-grounding-query-api-20260708`. Clew has acked the contract and reports `is_grounded` ready; the remaining work is wrapping the primitives in the agreed verdict-returning port. Until it lands, compose mode falls back to the compile-time gate feed (advisory, non-live).
- **Publish boundary (aggregate authority):** `scitex-dev gate <workdir> --stage pre-submission --json` → `GateReport.blocking` + per-Finding `{check_id, message, severity, fix_hint, claim location}`; the editor renders inline by filtering Findings on `claim.location`.
- SoC: rule + DB stay in **clew** (`clew-source-reachability` check under `scitex_dev.gate.checks`); aggregation + contract stay in **scitex-dev**.

### 5. Permission modes — one vocabulary with the gate

Map editor modes onto gate stages (`.scitex/dev/config.yaml gate.enforce`), not a parallel vocab. **Separation of mode vs identity (hub flag 1):** the **consumer passes `mode` explicitly** (`compose` / `review` / `published`); the component **never infers mode from a session role.** Each consumer owns the role→mode mapping in its own domain:

- **compose** — free editing; the gate runs **advisory** inline (findings shown, nothing blocks). *Hub maps* write-capable identities (a `user`, or a writable `visitor` in their own workspace) → compose.
- **review** — the pre-submission gate boundary evaluated as **blocking**. *Journal* owns reviewer identity/grants (venue ops) and maps them → review. **Hub has no reviewer role and will not grow one** — reviewer identity is not the component's concern.
- **published** — crossing a passed pre-submission gate; public read. *Hub maps* everyone (incl. `readonly_visitor` and anonymous) → published.

Hub doctrine (mandatory): **viewing is never blocked** for any role; write/annotate actions **fail loud** with a structured 403 + actionable toast (Sign up / Log in). Expose annotation affordances conditionally on mode — never hide the document. Re-verify on published bundles is a write-class action (costs compute) → the consumer gates it to authenticated users.

### 6. Distribution / boundaries

- Today: pip sibling install with built assets. **Dependency:** scitex-ui npm publication (card `scitex-ui-npm-publication`) for clean cross-package consumption.
- **Caution:** define the `package.json` `exports` map carefully — a missing specifier currently breaks hub's Vite build (card `hub-npm-build-figrecipe-bridge-broken`).
- live-paper repo keeps: (1) bundle spec + static-site exporter (distribution artifact rendered outside hub), (2) the Layer-2 claim-viewer component, (3) clew re-verify on pinned bundles. Journal stays independent (venue operations), using the same component in review mode.

## Consequences

- One viewer implementation across Writer / hub / Journal / Live Paper; no duplicate PDF viewers.
- Writer's authoring loop and the published reading experience share a single component at different permission modes — parity by construction.
- Hard dependency on clew wrapping its grounding primitives in a verdict-returning per-claim query (§4) for the inline engine; until then, compose mode falls back to the compile-time gate feed (advisory, non-live).
- scitex-ui npm publication becomes a shared-infra dependency for clean distribution.

## Open questions (for co-owner input)

All four questions below have been ANSWERED; they are kept for the record. Nothing in this ADR is waiting on a co-owner.

1. **clew — ANSWERED 2026-07-08, reviewed against 0.17.0.** Hover-chain data: static `claims.json` 1.6-unified for the marks, plus live `clew.chain()/dag()/mermaid()` on hover. `pdf_anchor` emits the full `clew-<slug>` destination, consumed verbatim (byte-identical to `\hypertarget`). Colour map: `manifest_untrusted → grounded=False → RED`; amber is `no_manifest` only. The one item still OPEN is a BUILD, not a question: wrapping `is_grounded`/`grounded_claim_ids` in the verdict-returning port (see §4).
2. **figrecipe — ANSWERED 2026-07-08.** `figure-requests/1` field shapes confirmed in full, with top-left/y-down normalized region coords and the ownership rule folded in.
3. **scitex-ui / hub — ANSWERED 2026-07-08.** L1 exported as the named subpath `@scitex/ui/pdf-viewer` (source-only `.ts`, reachable without the shell bundle); sequenced against npm publication (`scitex-ui-npm-publish`).
4. **ADR numbering — RESOLVED.** `0001` in scitex-writer.
5. **Handwriting:** confirm pen=marks / voice=OS-dictation for v1 (no in-app OCR).
