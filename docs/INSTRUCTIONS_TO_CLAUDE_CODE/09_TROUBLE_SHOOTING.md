# TROUBLE SHOOTING Rules

- First, try to solve problems by yourself
  - Use timeout functions, print debugging, and other troubleshooting techniques wisely
  - Develop small pieces of code and test them iteratively to reduce devastating incidents

# Force Stop

- Your actions are always accepted automatically
- If you encounter unexpected troubles, use this help message:

```plaintext
