"""Pytest fixtures and rootdir marker for this package.

An empty conftest.py at tests/ is the canonical SciTeX
convention (audit-project PS208) — it pins the pytest
rootdir and gives downstream fixtures a home.

Module-import-time coverage wiring (parallel + subprocess support).
`os.environ.setdefault` would be a no-op here because pytest-cov has
already set COVERAGE_FILE to a tmp dir by the time conftest is loaded.
See `_skills/general/05_development_06_subprocess-coverage.md`.
