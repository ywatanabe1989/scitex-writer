"""The shell-completion wiring must come from a PUBLIC peer name, unguarded.

Why this file exists — two defects lived in six lines here:

1. PRIVATE IMPORT. It reached into `scitex_dev._cli._completion`, a peer's
   underscore module. A peer can rename or move a private path without notice;
   the public name is the promise. `scitex_dev.cli.attach_shell_completion` is
   in that module's `__all__`, so it is the supported surface.

2. `except ImportError: pass`. scitex-dev is a HARD dependency of writer — it is
   always installed — so that guard was not protecting against a missing
   optional package. It was SWALLOWING a real breakage: if the peer ever dropped
   or renamed the symbol, shell completion would silently stop existing and
   nothing would say why. The same shape as the port that silently slid and the
   install hint that installed nothing.

The guard is gone and the floor carries the promise instead (scitex-dev>=0.30.0,
the first release exposing the public name). Below it, the CLI fails to import —
loudly, at install time, which is where a dependency problem belongs.
