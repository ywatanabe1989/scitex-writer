"""The workspace-shell downgrade message must name the RIGHT failure.

`except ImportError` around `scitex_app.embed` catches two failures — the
package being absent, and the package being present but older than the release
that added `.embed` — and the old code reported the first for both. A user who
reads "scitex-app is not installed", runs `pip show scitex-app`, and finds it
sitting right there concludes the message is lying, and goes and debugs
something else. That is the same defect as a remedy that does nothing: the
signal is present and wrong, which is worse than absent.

`describe_missing_shell` is pure so these run against real values with no mock
and no monkeypatch (PA-306 / STX-NM002).
