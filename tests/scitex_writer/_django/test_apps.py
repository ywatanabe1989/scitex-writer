"""ALL OR NOTHING: one feature extra, and the remedy we print must deliver it.

Why this file exists: writer used to offer three fine-grained extras
(`desktop`, `editor`, `scholar`), which asked users to predict at install time
which features they would later want. It got that wrong in the worst possible
way — `editor` was declared EMPTY (`editor = []`) while `_server.py`, `apps.py`
and the CLI all told anyone missing scitex-app to run
`pip install scitex-writer[editor]`. That remedy installed NOTHING. The user ran
the fix we handed them, stayed exactly as broken, and the editor kept serving
without the workspace shell.

An install instruction that resolves to a no-op is worse than no instruction:
the user believes they have already tried it.

The fleet rule (operator, 2026-07-13) is now ALL OR NOTHING: plain install for
the compile engine, `[all]` for every feature. `dev` / `docs` remain, because
those are for people building writer, not using it.

These tests read the real pyproject and pin the contract, so a future edit that
re-introduces a half-empty extra — or an error message naming an extra that
does not provide the module whose absence triggered it — fails HERE.
